    "content": "Phone? Dead. Railroad? Malfunctioning. Outfit? On point. It\u2019s your typical Sunday in New York City, and I\u2019m stuck in a station I\u2019ve never been in before. Trains decided to make their last stop in the middle of the route, and then head to a completely different borough. D\u2019s became B\u2019s and N\u2019s turned into Q\u2019s. I don\u2019t blame them though; sometimes I don\u2019t have a good grip on how I want to be perceived either.\n\nI should let my mom know I\u2019m going to be late. Maybe she could call me an uber too. Just like any native New Yorker, I should have no trouble talking to strangers and asking to use their phones. But\u2026I\u2019m\u00a0 too nervous to ask for help. What if they think my jacket is too big? What if they think my hairstyle is lame? Worst of all, what if I\u2019m mistaken for a tourist? The behavior of a typical New Yorker truly is a double-edged sword.\nHearing the pitter-patter of small feet on the tracks, I turn and lock eyes with a rat. Some people may flinch, or even throw up at the sight of a sewer rat. But real New Yorkers can see each other eye to eye and find solace in times like these, even if it is just a rat.\nI could ask him for help. Even if he\u00a0 does judge me, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ll understand him.\n\nI pinch my nose and jump into the depths of the tracks, my feet splashing against the murky subway\u2026water? Semantics aside, I chase my new best friend, Alfonzo into the dark subway\u00a0 tunnel.\n\nAs I chase Alfonzo down the tracks, he gives me a few pointers on basic rat speak. I guess I should think of some good comebacks in case they do decide to make fun of me now. \u201cHow does it feel to have the ugliest hairstyle to be modeled after you?\u201d Is that too harsh? I could workshop later. He teaches me some other things too, such as how there\u2019s one rat for every person in the world. Is that like a statistic? A religious thing? Some wicked science experiment? Alfonzo quickly changed the subject. For now, it\u2019s just me, him, and the shadows of the tunnel.\n\nAfter skittering for what felt like hours we came to a stop to what I assume is Alfonzo\u2019s rat tribe. I couldn\u2019t make out everything they said but it was something along the lines of\u2026\n\n*Meep chatter meep*\n\u201cWhat do you need, kid?\u201d\n*Chatter chatter squeak*\n\u201cOh I just need to get on a local R bound train\u201d\n*Squeak squeak meep meep chatter scitter*\n\u201cOh, the R train?! Why didn\u2019t you ask sooner?\u201d\n*Scitter meep chatter*\n\u201cHow long do you think the wait will b-\u201d\nI hear a roaring pounding down the track. A massive wave of rats spilled into view in front of me.\n*Meep squeak!*\n\u201cASSEMBLE\u201d\nUpon that command, the rats begin to link their tails into chains. They used those chains to link onto each other, morphing into a greater mass: A train.\n*Meep sitter squeak meep?!*\n\u201cRats could do that the whole time?!\n*Squeak Meep skitter*\n\u201cYou betcha. We\u2019re New Yorkers aren't we?\u201d\nI step into the rat train, careful not to harm my new companions, my family. Some of them even break formation to transform into a seat for me. How hospitable.\u00a0\n\nThe 86th street station gets filled with an uproar of screams as a train made of rats spills out and floods the platform. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t be very surprised if I was one of the bystanders watching such a spectacle. This is just your typical Sunday in New York City.\n*Squeak meep chatter chatter skitter*\n\u201cIt looks like this is the end. We don\u2019t expect anything in return. Just the wish that you\u2019ll think of us whenever you swipe your MetroCard.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoodbye Alfonzo!\u201d I couldn\u2019t bear to say it in ratspeak as I was barely able to get the words out of my mouth through snotty sobs and tearful gasps.\n\nI unlock the doors to my house, skitter up the steps, quickly correcting my posture to make sure I don\u2019t make a scene in front of my mom. She probably wouldn\u2019t let me go into the City anymore if she found out what I was doing, hanging out with sketchy characters she\u2019s never met before. But she doesn\u2019t need to know that. She just needs to know I got back safe, with the help of friends I\u2019ll never forget.",

    "title": "The Benefits of Climate Change for a Brooklyn Tech Student",
    "authors": ["lawer-nyako"],
    "issue": "december-2021",
    "content": "While we slowly bake like a slice of toast in the warming convection oven that is Earth, Brooklyn Tech students are reaping the benefits of this very harmful beneficial situation.\nYou thought the NYC subway was unsafe before, well, with climate change, get ready to have a lot more delays due to suspicious floating scuba suits. With funky fresh new flooding, now you can travel across the tunnels of our great city with the power of tin cans (for the financially insecure) or old subway cars (for the bourgeoisie elite).\n\nFlooding won\u2019t just help the subways, though. At the start of every semester, every tech student\u2019s biggest fear is seeing their schedule and finding out they have a class in the basement. And the Brooklyn Tech staff, being the sadists that they are, will certainly have that class be right before lunch. Well, for the price of just a few extra inches in sea level, this problem goes away. Once we completely engulf the basement (maybe even some of the lower floors) with water, Brooklyn Tech will be rid of the leading cause of leg injuries among students to date.\nAnd, besides the benefits of floods, snow days will likely be worse (in a good way)! In the old days, we could\u2019ve skipped school more. However, it\u2019s harder to profit from snow days now. Harder, not impossible, even though\u00a0 As you may be thinking that because the DOE has made snow days virtual, snow days don\u2019t really matter. But if you, a BTHS student, think you still can\u2019t reap the benefits of these worsened snow days, you\u2019ve clearly forgotten that the heating in your apartment sucks, and your 7-year-old laptop is literally incapable of comprehending temperatures below 30. This is a blessing in disguise because you now have a one-way ticket to acquiring frostbite and skipping class even more.\nAt the start of every semester, every tech student\u2019s biggest fear is seeing their schedule and finding out they have a class in the basement. And the Brooklyn Tech staff, being the sadists that they are, will certainly have that class be right before lunch. They will then force students to endure climbing hundreds of stairs every single day. Now, what if for the price of just a few extra inches in sea level this problem could go away? How, I hear you ask? By completely flooding the basement. With this, the basement (maybe even some of the lower floors) will be engulfed by water, ridding Brooklyn Tech of the largest cause of leg injuries among students to date.\nAnd, with the basement (and possibly some of the lower floors) becoming a giant swimming pool, Brooklyn Tech conveniently has people perfectly prepared to use this to their advantage: the swim team. Sure, we already had a pool, but now we have more pool. Throw a couple of giant water filters into the school, and you have access to multiple Olympic pools in one, which also has access to a built-in locker room and forensic room (to check on anyone who doesn\u2019t get out).\nAlthough many other school\u2019s swim teams will be able the enjoy the benefits of a flooded school (not Stuyvesant, though, since their escalators would electrify the pool and create a giant watery frying pan for any would-be midwestern county fair enthusiasts), due to Brooklyn Tech\u2019s architecture, Tech\u2019s swim team and their world-renowned mega pool will dominate in swimming competitions for years to come. The figure eight of the building and the labyrinth of the basement will be sure to revolutionize swimming pool technology.\n\nWhether it becomes melting hot or freezing cold, climate change will revolutionize the in-school travel methods of everyone at Tech. The bottoms of our shoes will either melt or freeze, giving us the ability to slide around the hallways. Not only will this rapidly speed up the hallway movement at Tech leading to the creation of a new track sport (cross-hallway track), but also, it will give Tech this multi-floor ice rink that will make Tech the most popular generic first date site in the borough year-round. This will be combined with inherently making the stair leagues better, making it easier, and adding a fun factor while not changing the danger level in any meaningful way to the down staircase. Although going upstairs will become impossible in this condition, this may finally be the thing that causes them to fix the elevators.\nAll of this should be enough to convince us that climate change should continue to happen. In fact, we as Tech students should lead this charge. Let\u2019s make cows eat as many beans as possible to make the gassiest farts. Let\u2019s have our phones rely on oil for power. Let\u2019s drill directly below that one weird room in the basement that never opens because we all know the environmental kids are hiding the oil and coal there to \u201cstop people from accessing the boiler.\u201d We need to do this not only for our benefit but for the benefit of all future tech students in history class, who will have us to thank for improving transportation, sports, academics, and mental health for Brooklyn Tech students around the world.",

    "authors": ["ramon-li"],
    "issue": "april-2022",
    "content": "This time on Hell's Cafeteria: Four students in the Law and Society major, Lil Debil, Sammie-Wammie, Ovaltine, and Daniel, will be competing in the Boys\u2019 Bathroom Challenge to decide who will enter the final round and become a head chef at Rordon Gamsay\u2019s Hell\u2019s Cafeteria in Brooklyn Tech, New York City.\n\n\u201cThis challenge should be simple even for Technites like you,\u201d Rordon Gamsay explained, \u201cYou will be cooking\u00a0 a large bowl of noodles for the poor, starving souls outside who are probably cutting class. However, you can only use the tools available in this bathroom and this fridge of ingredients. Alright? Begin!\u201d\n\nSammie-Wammie and Ovaltine got off to a strong start, mincing onions, broccoli, and lettuce with their bare hands, as any LAS student would. They then heated up several slices of ham under hot faucet water. But then, disaster struck. Just as their sink could pump no more hot water, Rordon Gamsay began staring at them through a tiny gap in a bathroom stall.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing with that sad lump of meat?\u201d Gamsay screamed while flushing the toilet, \u201cAnd I\u2019m not talking about you Sammie-Wammie. I\u2019m talking about your sorry excuse for green eggs and ham, which you shouldn\u2019t even be making. Dump that out and restart. Sam-I-Am, more like Sam-I-Amn\u2019t!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes chef,\u201d Sammie-Wammie sobbed.\n\nAround the corner, Daniel was busy soaking a slab of chicken in the toilet. \u201cHey nitwit,\u201d Gamsay roared, \u201cWe\u2019re not here to protest the bathroom policy. Stop vandalizing that toilet and put that chicken in the sink. Capiche?\u201d\n\n\u201cCapoche,\u201d Daniel uttered, visibly shaken.\n\nMeanwhile, Lil Debil used his \u201c35 years\u201d of cooking experience and his last, sleep-deprived, brain cell to boil a packet of noodles. Though he\u2019s currently failing math, he instinctively filled his bowl with the perfect volume of water and stirred. And stirred. And dozed off to sleep, his eyes wide open.\n\nWith all the preparations complete, the rest of the chefs threw their ingredients into the bowl. The result looked more like a Frankenstein\u2019s monster than a culinary masterpiece, but it was still their dish, their child. Ovaltine sauntered around the bathroom with this precious child in hand.\n\n\u201cHurry up,\u201d Gamsay shouted, \u201cThe only thing graceful about you, Ovaltine, is how you\u2019re going to be eliminated if you don\u2019t pick up the pace.\u201d\n\nOvaltine froze dead in her tracks as DDP flashbacks flooded her mind. In a moment of uncontrollable terror, she bolted out the bathroom and chucked the chefs\u2019 child at the students outside.\n\n\u201cWait a second, why is the chicken pink?\u201d one student questioned.\n\nThe chefs felt Gamsay\u2019s face fuming behind them and began saying their prayers. \u201cDamn Daniel, back at it again with RAW CHICKEN!\u201d He hollered, \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of this. Daniel, you\u2019re out. Lil Debil, you\u2019re also out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d Lil Debil asked, now wide awake.\n\n\u201cDid you even notice me shouting at you?\u201d Gamsay screamed, \u201cNo. You were asleep as if this was history class.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you-\u201d Lil Debil gasped.\n\nTwo lunch aides suddenly appeared behind Lil Debil and dragged him out. With only two chefs remaining, who will win it all? Find out next time on Hell's Cafeteria!",

    "title": "Santa Claus Cancelled",
    "authors": ["phoenix-thorwall"],
    "issue": "february-2021",
    "content": "Mr. Claus has been running Christmas since 280 A.D., slowly building his empire. During this time, not only has he gained a monopoly on the consuming milk and cookies industry (albeit through questionable legal practices), Santa has also become a major supporter of renewable energy through his deer-powered motor systems.\nBut we have uncovered the truth. We now know who the real Santa underneath the Christmas tree is. The following accounts have been provided to us through whistleblowers and our team of investigative reporters:\n* Various high-end business affiliates admitted to receiving intelligence from the North Pole on what toy stocks would go up based on holiday letters to Santa.\n* Some of Santa\u2019s comments on the job have made elves uncomfortable.\n* The Reindeer Union threatened to strike, indicating that poor wages and ruthless work hours have gone on for too long.\n\n* We traced investments in a venison meat company to Mr. Claus as reindeers mysteriously disappear\u2014including fan favorite Blitzen.\nIn an attempt to salvage his reputation after these damning facts were revealed this week, Santa posted the following tweets, which have, hopefully out of shame, since been deleted.\n> A ho ho ho to all the people of the world!\n>\n> As you may have heard, over the past couple of months there have been investigations on how I treat everyone in the workforce and beyond. I realize now that many unspeakable things have happened here at the North Pole. I take those things very seriously and I want to apologize to the poor souls who were affected. Those things never should have happened. I know that I am in a position of privilege and power. With that comes responsibility. So, I take responsibility for all that happened at my workshops.\n\n>\n> In a healing effort, I had conversations with the Reindeer Union about plans for the future. We are beginning to make the necessary changes. Starting with allowing them to go outside and graze on days other than Christmas. Today we are starting a new chapter.\n>\n> I recognize I haven\u2019t always communicated myself the best in the past, too. When I said, \u201cYou should show more of those pointy ears, if you know what I mean,\u201d my only intention was to communicate that my colleagues should be prouder of where they came from. Of course, there are some things that should just be left unsaid\n>\n> People have been saying that I\u2019m not the \u201coh-so-jolly fellow\u201d I showcase to the world every Christmas. But, the truth is, while I am very much that jolly fat man, I\u2019m also a lot of other things. Sometimes I\u2019m mad, sad, nervous, anxious, frustrated, and impatient. I am working on all of that. I am a work in progress.\n\n>\n> This is me. My intention is to always be the best possible version of myself. If I\u2019ve ever let someone down, if I\u2019ve ever hurt their feelings, I am so sorry for that. If that\u2019s ever the case. I let myself down And, more importantly, I have let my fans down. But let's not forget, just like all of you, I am a work in progress.\n>\n> I got into this business to spread cheer and make people smile. Instead, it seems that I may or may not have spread other feelings with my \\*alleged\\* misuse of mistletoe. And so, allegedly, I would like to apologize. I just want you all to know I am still the same Santa Claus you know and love.\n\n>\n> Later today, I will post the zoom link for Blitzen\u2019s memorial service. His untimely death shocked us all. I assure you that I\u2019ll do everything in my power to get him the justice he deserves.\n>\n> Finally, I\u2019d just like to wish you all a happy Christmas and merry new year\n>\n> With much love,\n>\n> Saint Nick\nThat poor excuse of an apology, if you could even call it that, barely touched the hearts of anyone around the world. In fact, this tweet was the spark that started the flame. A flame in which return rates on presents went up by 87% Santa Claus has officially gone bankrupt and lost ownership of his oh ho ho so precious holiday.\n\nAfter an intense auction, Jack Skellington became the new heir to the Christmas empire. Dear readers, prepare yourselves for Halloween 2, featuring all your favorite treats in their exclusive peppermint flavored counterparts.",

    "title": "Our Favorite Wrong SAT Answers",
    "authors": ["ethan-perkis"],
    "issue": "january-2022",
    "content": "SAT results for this year have been published! We at The Radish received a list of the most common incorrect answers and would like to share it with you all to help.\n\nIf you got any of these wrong, be sure to let us know in smoke signs, graffiti, or astral projection. Without further ado, let\u2019s begin!\nQuestion 23: Reading section\nWhat is the theme of the text?\nA. Greed\nB. Dogs\nC. Ur mom\nD. Fortnite\nThe answer to this question was, quite obviously, C. Although we have made the shift to \u201cur uncle\u201d recently, it stands correct as the entire passage centers around the main character, whose name can only be uttered in a shape human tongues were not meant to become, dealing with the trauma of her mother. Although Fortnite and dogs are both wonderful, they aren\u2019t a catch-all. Finally, although A seems appropriate due to the main character\u2019s selfish actions, it\u2019s ultimately not a her problem so why do you have to gaslight her like that.\nQuestion 63: Grammar section\nPick the grammatically correct option.\nA. He walked, calmly.\nB. Heawalkedclamly\nC. Wlakdeh ylmcal,\nD. What have I written. How have we fallen so far from grace.\nThe answer to this question was C. A shouldn\u2019t have a comma in the middle, and should end with a comma; it\u2019s a dependent clause I think but who am I to say other than someone with a degree. B lacks any form of punctuation, making it an unviable answer. D should have ended with a question mark. That leaves only C, which properly uses commas, as the correct answer, you silly idiots who got it wrong.\nQuestion 298392: Math section\nWhere does line mx+b intersect with b?\nA. Hell\nB. Purgatory\nC. x = 0\nD. Heaven\nSorry to all the losers and haters who didn\u2019t get it, the answer was B. A and D are both wrong because the holy order dictates that heaven must be above hell, making both of those answers sacreligious. C is incorrect because I\u2019m really not vibing with it today \ud83d\ude44\nWe hope that these answers will help you on your next test. We wish you all good scores and bad colleges.",

In a note they said the following:\n* It\u2019s time to remove dark mode. Dark mode has connotations of fury, hatred, and when the lights turn off at nighttime and it\u2019s so scary. Because of this, we are removing it.\n\n* As an alternative to light mode, there will be a fresh option called \u201cred mode\u201d This aesthetic look will feature a red background with orange words. Red mode will make a good alternative for people with deep cult-level biases against light mode. Besides, this color will be better for your eyes; we want to keep you awake late at night wondering, \u201cwhere did all this red come from?\u201d\n* Reactions will now have a red background behind the usual blue background to make them pop out more.\n* Now, until a server hits 100 members, all members will automatically have admin privileges. This will help eliminate inequality and Dill changing my nickname and being so rude all the time in friend groups.\n* Fixed a bug where you get banned for posting NSFW content in #general.\n* Emojis are no longer available without Discord Nitro.\n* People can no longer add reactions with emoji they don\u2019t have\u2014even if the emoji was already reacted to a message.\nI hope that you\u2019re as excited about these updates as I am.

Enjoy! \nPisces: Your birthstone may be a pink salt crystal, but don\u2019t be salty.\nAries: Your birthstone is a new stone added to the earth sciences curriculum. Known only as blortlesnap, this rock is robin's-egg blue, completely edible, and smells like the concept of infinity. Any student who can bring in a sample of it will receive a 100 for the marking period.\nTaurus: Your birthstone is alive. It seeks\u2026 something. It does not know what, but it will begin destroying all the Tauruses that it sees in the hopes that this will complete its unconscious craving. Our only survival tip is to leave behind the children and elderly, and run. Safe travels!\nGemini: Your birthstone is an icosahedral quasicrystal. We have no idea what that means, so good luck figuring that out.\nCancer: Your birthstone is deep in the recesses of the hollow earth, among the dinosaurs, JFK clones, and hidden government projects.\nLeo: We couldn\u2019t possibly tell what your birthstone is. No, seriously, if we told you your birthstone\u2019s name, the knowledge would literally destroy part of your brain.\nVirgo: Your birthstone is embedded deep inside of a dead man\u2019s skull. It will be found one day, but will have a terrible price of $0.59. It will be the most beautiful gem discovered yet, but worth about as much as a crumpled plastic cup.\nLibra: Your birthstone is a piece of Apocrypha, you holy creature of a zodiac sign.\nScorpio: Your stone will allow you to whack others upside the head with it. What is it, you say? \u2018Tis but pure granite. Have fun causing brain damage and being punished for said brain damage.\nSagittarius: We live to feel pain so that we may know joy. So, your birthstone is a dented skull to make you feel the pains of others. It will also bleed dead people\u2019s blood. You will be tortured with the pain of a thousand burning suns, but the skull looks pretty cool.\nCapricorn: Your birthstone is a blueberry. Have a delicious zodiac treat, you monster.\n",

The following items will be confiscated on sight, and will result in the confiscation of the owner\u2019s student ID: bug juice, juice bugs, juiced bugs, pets (mammalian, reptilian, and alien), any kind of unregistered hunting implements, including blow pipes, python fangs, and rusted lead pipe, not explicitly allowed by your advisor for a scheduled excursion, or a musical instrument not explicitly allowed by a music teacher, such as a banjo, a kidnapped child, or a heart of darkness. To get your ID back, just pay the SGO $50 cash, 37 alligator teeth, 5 python skins, or 78.2 gallons of congealed swamp water. \n\n- After the recent Florida man vs. Brooklyn Techstep team competition, the Florida men have taken the lockers for themselves, proclaiming it to be \u201cnew Floridia.\u201d One of our reporters, sophomore Christin J\u00e9sus, went to investigate. He came out minutes later intoxicated and covered from head to toe in tattoos and grime. When asked what he saw, only a few words could be distinguished from his inaudible mumblings, \u201cDamn gators\u2026 government\u2026.kazoo\u201d before passing out. Wish him luck in recovery! Furthermore, as a consequence of the locker room seizure, and definitely not of the release of several live alligators in the locker rooms, gym classes have been temporarily canceled. Hope you have an external gym membership; otherwise, you won\u2019t be exercising anytime soon (that is unless you run into a hunting party of florida men).\n\n- The SGO store is now selling torn versions of the school shirts, incidentally 3 live alligators (not to be confused with the 9th floor crocodile) were released into the storeroom last week by a group of Florida men. Despite this, students seem to love the new design, resulting in the SGO opportunistically marking up the price by 75%. However, in a statement released by the SGO, they said that they would not modify already existing shirts, the sanity of their hired Florida man for shirt-cutting, as they had to lay off the gators for attempting to unionize, has not yet been determined. \u201cWe think he might snap,\u201d wrote the SGO. \u201cSnap like an SGO rubber band! One could be yours for our  low, low $2 for 1 prices! Only slightly worse than dollar store ones! You want to support The Survey extracurricular activities, right?\u201d The report continues for 8 more pages of advertising and self-praising screeds. Nonetheless, all of our staff has purchased the shirts, and boy, are we fashionable.\n\n\u201cWe hope that these incidents do not affect the learning of the students,\u201d the principal whispered over the PA, hiding from roving bands of florida men inside his office\u2019s topiary garden. \u201cIn the case that it does, please come to snacks with the principal to chat,\u201d he said, whilst the sounds of his being dragged away by the Florida men echoed throughout the school.\n",

    "content": "*During the Hybrid Learning Dark Age of Brooklyn Technical High School, I, like many other unsuspecting freshmen, attended the AP History information Zoom session. However, we should have heeded the warnings of our superiors to not take AP World or AP Euro just for course credits. My mindset has changed from nervous to furious from corrupt grading policies. My energy has gone from active to dormant and my spirit has been shattered. But my determination to complete the class has stayed the same. I mean, who are we kidding, we only enrolled for the course credit.*\n*Besides, I\u2019m very happy to be here, really. As an literate student of a prestigess specialized hi schoo, I luv putting in affort to do in+ensive homework asinments. THEREFORE, I will put effort into exte\u00f1sively analyzing the LEQ essay format in order to get more practice on my homework! I expect nothing less than a 6 on my exam results.\u00a0The result of my anallysis is below.*\nThe intended audience for this document is literate students of Brooklyn Technical High school taking AP World and AP Euro classes, which is why this document is published on The Radish, a major catalyst for cultural diffusion across Brooklyn Tech. Every month, this newspaper is read by all 6,000 students of the school.\n\nThe purpose of this document is to glorify the efficiency and productivity of AP World and Euro students because we are, obviously, all on top of every assignment for our coveted AP credit.\n\nEvery day, we click the \u201cMark as done\u201d button of a new Google Classroom assignment. We get to copy 15-paragraph bullet notes on slides in 15 seconds. We relish every moment we have the privilege to annotate in Cornell format.\nOur work ethic made trade across the Instagram network is more efficient because our shared passion for the subject of history led to the creation of group chats such as \u201cAP world gc\u201d and \u201c\\[REDACTED TEACHER]\u2019s class is the death of me.\u201d These chats facilitated the exchange of \u201csuchases,\u201d such as, \u201cwhere is the tokugawa poetry and painting project? I can\u2019t find it. What do you mean it\u2019s right under the projects tab?\u201d as well as \u201cWill she accept late work???\u201d and \u201cBro this class is so \\[REDACTED].\u201d\n\nThis is a continuity in our history, as we, little puny sophomores mimic the trends of the LEGENDARY MONGOL EMPIRE (without most of the violence). During the post classical era, the Mongol authority and protection over the Silk Road, The Pax Mongolia, facilitated a safe exchange of goods and ideas such as paper money and Islam across the Middle East and Asia. For example, as the Mongols expanded their empire, they would take scholars from all around the Middle East and move them into their capital city of Karakoram. \nBy having the greatest minds from all across the Middle East collaborating, there\u2019s a high chance for a boom in new advancements and innovations such as mathematics and gunpowder warfare. The Mongols would then tax the merchants that made money from exchanging these new popular and high end goods. This shows how the Silk Road is one of the most advanced and intricate trade networks because the Mongols were organized enough to purposely enforce diffusion that made the trade route more efficient.\n\nIn conclusion!",

    "issue": "march-2020",
    "content": "You've probably questioned the stench of clothing stores at least once. It\u2019s such a specific smell. However, if you\u2019ve been to a graveyard, you may recognize the exact same smell, give or take a few stench units. \nPeople, open your eyes and realize there are dead people in clothing stores. \nHow haven\u2019t you noticed? Well, they hide the the corpses in the best place possible: mannequins. After some data collection in nine different countries, we found out that 83.45% of all mannequins are made out of people. The rest of the materials can be found in this graph:\n![what materials do each country use for mannequins](https://storage.googleapis.com/radish-2bd31.appspot.com/old-assets/what-material-do-each-country-use-for-mannequins.png \"what materials do each country use for mannequins\")\nWe can see that China chooses to mostly make their mannequins out of plastic out of respect for human lives. However, most of the other countries choose to disregard the beauty of life and use people for their clothing displays.\nWe interviewed the heads of three different mannequin manufacturers, Definitely Plastic People, 100% Synthetic Mannequins Totally, and Mannequins That Are Not People. Their names will be kept secret to protect their identities. A collective comment that came from all of them was that they \u201cdo not use people to create mannequins.\u201d But, during our interview, the representative showed all the tells of a liar, such as being nervous and constantly stuttering. They also told us \u201cget out of my house, how did you get in?\u201d and kept asking, \u201cwhy do you have a baseball bat?\u201d Pretty suspicious stuff.\nOur second action about this topic was to slice open mannequins and prove that they were made from human flesh. When entering the nearest Target, we were stopped by security. Only two of us escaped, while the rest were arrested, which definitely had nothing to do with the ski masks and crowbars we equipped ourselves with. We can see from this incident that the security guards of Target are also attempting to hide the truth. Everyone\u2019s in on it, and we\u2019ll be exposing the truth for you. \nThis is The Radish, debunking the lies of the world, one at a time.",

    "authors": ["sadie-allspaw"],
    "issue": "december-2021",
    "content": "New research study shows alien abduction of cows to be a major force in stopping climate change because it prevents them from farting and releasing a no-good greenhouse gas called methane. In fact, places with more alien UFO sightings such as Idaho and Utah show a 10% decrease in cow farts.\n![Things that Help the Climate](https://storage.googleapis.com/radish-2bd31.appspot.com/old-assets/things-that-help-the-environment.png \"Things that Help the Climate\")\nOne New Mexico town has actually started worshiping these aliens, which they used to be scared of. Upon closer inspection, people appear to be lighting candles, leaving out Reese's Pieces, and some townspeople have even started sacrificing small animals, such as birds and squirrels. \nWe talked to the leader of one of these alien fan clubs, Bobert Snot, a \"former\" conspiracy theorist. \u201cI used to be scared of the little green men. They tried to control my thoughts and replace my family with imposters. But now I\u2019m just glad the polar ice caps have stopped melting. If you can\u2019t beat \u2018em, join \u2018em. It\u2019s official\u2013 I\u2019m hanging up my tin foil hat.\u201d\nSome have begun to vote for these aliens as their local representatives. It\u2019s a phenomenon that has spread, now seen in about 500 small towns. We interviewed Dr. James Butterfingers, a leading political scientist, to tell us about these strange patterns. \u201cActually,\u201d Dr. Butterfingers says, \u201cI\u2019ve run the numbers\u2026 Trust me, I have run simulation after simulation. Each time, the aliens end up being the best choice for office\u2026 Excuse me, I have to go.\u201d Shortly after, Dr. Butterfingers resigned due to how \u201cabsolutely ridiculous American politics have gotten.\u201d\nThrough much scientific innovation, NASA was able to momentarily establish communication with these aliens. \u201cIf you let us become your overlords and take over most of your major cities to use as breeding grounds, we promise to create jobs in the sustainable energy industry, and to dedicate more resources to helping endangered species.\u201d While these aliens seem nice, we think they\u2019re a little optimistic.",

    "authors": ["ramon-li"],
    "issue": "january-2022",
    "content": "It\u2019s that special time of the year again, that special time when Tech students scramble to get extracurriculars onto their transcripts. Unfortunately, after meeting with my guidance counselor and learning that writing for The Radish didn't have the persuasive power with the Harvard admissions committee that I thought it would, I have found myself among these desperate children. While many have stuck with traditional activities, like spying for the secret police known as the CTC or paying Key Club, others have stumbled upon an exciting new activity: making dysfunctional websites for dysfunctional organizations! Not only will you get paid (hopefully), but you can also learn how to do the-bugging and uphold Broken Tech\u2019s namesake.\n\nTo help me feel better after being rejected by the institution of college, my gracious, wonderful, kindhearted editor assigned me the prestigious job of interviewing the people of TopCasino, a site exemplifying creative risk-taking by challenging our definition of functional. Despite being one of the earliest dysfunctional websites created this month, it has aged surprisingly well. Sure the site may look sketchy to the uninitiated, and, sure, most of its links are blocked by my firewall, but it's the thought and hour of work poured into this site that counts.\n\nTake it from Ermine, official unofficial designer at TopCasino. \u201cIt\u2019s fun. I can collect all the phone numbers I want,\u201d she explained. But why ask every user for their phone number upon registration? \u201cIt\u2019s simple. How else am I going to collect them?\u201d she smiled. With such passion and drive, she is definitely going places (and onto certain lists), all thanks to this site.\n\nFortunately, this passion is shared by all of TopCasino\u2019s employees, like senior procrastinator James. \u201cI just want to get paid, but it\u2019s really terrifying,\u201d he began before dozing off to sleep. \u201cI know, it\u2019s terrifyingly awesome,\u201d I finished for him. This environment lets you contemplate how little you value your sanity. \u201cIt\u2019s a money laundering campaign! There's no proof it isn't one!\u201d James suddenly blurted. He\u2019s dreaming. All that contemplation must have gone to his head. Repeat after me James, \u201cThere is no money laundering in TopCasino. The money laundering monster can\u2019t hurt you.\u201d\n\nAfter all, there\u2019s no way an innocent site like TopCasino could be used for nefarious purposes. They\u2019re not trying to steal your bank information. They just need it to convert your money from USD to crypto to USD. They\u2019re also not trying to lure you in with crypto references to mine crypto off your computer. In the wise words of their Ermine, \u201cAll those references to crypto shouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d So, they\u2019re not malicious; they\u2019re just a bit negligent. But aren\u2019t we all? Don\u2019t we all forget some things on a whim?\u00a0\n\nAnd so, TopCasino is truly a completely functional and wonderful site for everyone, a great opportunity for extracurricular-hungry Tech students.",

He tells jokes, makes schedules, and so much more!\u201d\nSurely, Bonzibuddy was a deal I could not pass up. I wanted a new computer companion. I downloaded the sucker instantly. But much to my disappointment, I didn\u2019t just get a web companion. I also got dangerous spyware that rendered my computer essentially unusable.\nLittle did I know at the time that this spyware would start my epic journey of innovation and self-discovery.\nWhen my computer began heating to dangerous levels, I flipped it upside down. If there\u2019s one thing that I\u2019ve learned from those easy money websites, it\u2019s that the grind must never end, even if your computer risks exploding. Well, the computer was definitely a heated platform. So, I realized, what was stopping me from cooking with it? Nothing was stopping me but myself.\nIn test trials, I noticed my food was enhanced with metals, which has allowed me to give up my iron supplements and save fat stacks of cash.\nOnce I abandoned my old-fashioned oven and stove, I sold them and turned off the heat to my house; the toasty 50 degrees Celsius GPU was more than enough to accommodate me. This streamlined use of Benjamins has made me quite wealthy and helped fund my 12-part series on laptop cooking\u2014which is now available on Skillshare!\nLooking back, sometimes I wonder if I would change anything about my journey. I wouldn\u2019t. I simply laugh at the haters. Ha ha ha those silly haters. I can now laugh at those puny gaming PC fans who told me that Vista was \u201coutdated\u201d and \u201cvulnerable.\u201d I can also laugh at my doctor, who has said that consuming laptop metal was \u201cseverely dangerous to my intestines.\u201d And to all my aspiring chefs out there, remember to stay strong against those who doubt your genius.\n",

Have a Monday,\u201d leaving a cloud of silence (and a smaller cloud of wasps who were nesting in the speakers) in every classroom. How awkward.\n\n10:19 AM. 3rd period has ended and the gossip cycle has begun. The lame sophomores have flocked to Instagram. The lamer sophomores have gone to Discord. A consensus has yet to be reached. The meaning of the morning\u2019s coded message is still a mystery.\n\n11:48 AM. 5th period (the objectively worst lunch period) is starting. Some students have claimed that the grunt was a vign\u00e9re cipher and are still desperately searching for the keyword. Some are trying to transcribe the hphfffffffff in invisible ink as a summoning ritual. For what? That\u2019s what they aim to find out.

    "title": "Dealing With Your Teen During Covid-19",
    "authors": ["gabrielle-greenblatt"],
    "issue": "november-2020",
    "content": "Times have been pressing for families everywhere, causing a strain felt hardest in the already-tense relationship between teenagers and their parents. I have seen countless articles on how to ease that strain on mommy blogs all over the internet, but I have yet to see one written from the perspective of a teen. Why are we listening to only one side? We shouldn\u2019t. So, I, a local teen, wrote this article.\n\nThe most important thing to remember is that empathy is key. Your teen is under a lot of stress. They may find ways to blow off stress you don\u2019t approve of, like playing loud games online, staying up all night to talk to friends, and planning a violent overthrow of our current corrupt capitalist system. Although these behaviors might be punishable under normal circumstances, they already have adults criticizing their every move. Imagine having teachers hounding you for work, people of older generations seeing you as a disgrace, and a team of FBI agents tracking your every move. Now throw a disapproving parent into the mix. Sounds like a nightmare, doesn\u2019t it? Don\u2019t do that to your child.\n\nThe best action you can take is to support your teen\u2019s hobbies. If they want to game professionally, don\u2019t tell them that you are disappointed, or that what they want is stupid. Support them, let them play, and offer encouragement when they need it. Offer them a ride to their protests, buy them the gasoline for their Molotov cocktails, and provide an alibi. What\u2019s even better is taking an active interest in what they are doing. Ask them how to play Fortnite, or when they realized the myth of \u201crags to riches\u201d was used to keep the poor complicit. Or, if you\u2019re feeling extra confident, what the tea is in the group chat. Who knows, they might want to tell you.\nGive your teen space. You hear this tip all the time, and I understand it can be hard, but I cannot overstate how important it is. You don\u2019t need to know everything going on in our lives. Our teen years are when we blossom on our own and choose who we want to become.\n\nBut support is key when giving your teen space. How could we move to college without your help? How would we have the confidence to go out on our own? When the time comes to leave and lead our guerilla insurgency, make sure we know you\u2019ll always love us, no matter how much collateral damage we do in our fight for freedom. Civilian deaths can weigh heavily on the liberated soul, and your support can mean the difference between giving up and success.\n\nAnd parents, just remember, when all is said and done, and it is time to right your wrongs and build on the ashes of the previous society, you\u2019ll want me to put in a good word for you.\n\nYou have nothing to lose but your chains.",

    "title": "Tourist's Guide to New York City",
    "authors": ["maxime-ennis"],
    "issue": "june-2021",
    "content": "Tourists, with the summer, are getting nearer and nearer to the wonderful city of New York. And since, when visiting a new place for the first time, it is always helpful to have a guide to help you, I have created a guide for New York City tourists to give the true \u201cnew yawker\u201d experience.\n\n1. The accent.\n\n    First and foremost, in order to be taken seriously by other New Yorkers, you MUST talk in a New York accent. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with this type of accent, no worries, you\u2019ll catch on as quickly as coronavirus!\u00a0\n\n    When pronouncing words that have the \u201co\u201d sound, use \u201caw\u201d instead of \u201co.\u201d Also be sure to keep in mind that words ending in g never pronounce the g. New Yorkers also rarely say \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you\u201d, replacing them with actions such as finger guns or what is referred to as the \u201cfboy face.\u201d\n\n    For example, the phrase \u201cHello how are you? Can I please have a cup of coffee?\u201d would turn into \u201cAyyyyy ow are ya doin\u2019 man? Ay can I uh get a uh cup of the cawfee?\u201d The phrase \u201cExcuse me I need to get by\u201d would become, \u201cAyy pally bada bing bada boom what\u2019re ya doin\u2019 I\u2019m wawlkin\u2019 \u2018ere.\u201d\n\n2. Walking around the city.\n\n    Now that you know how to talk like a New Yorker, you also need to know how to walk around the city like one.\u00a0\n\n    Despite the stereotype that New Yorkers walk fast, if you go to Times Square, you will see the opposite. Now, you might be wondering, why are people moving so slow there? Well, it\u2019s a custom to walk extremely slowly\u2014especially when you are in a large group of people on a small sidewalk, full of people who just need to get to the nearest hot dog cart on time. New Yorkers love a challenge and it is a wonderful challenge to get where you need to go if there\u2019s a huge group of people walking slower than the city\u2019s free wifi.\u00a0\n\n    Another thing: a beautiful sunset is rarely seen in New York, so, if you see one, be sure to stop in the middle of the road and take exactly 40 pictures. If you take less than 40 pictures, New Yorkers will shun you and throw you out of the city. You\u2019d better appreciate that sunset.\n\n3. Public transportation.\n\n    Now that you know how to walk, don\u2019t. It\u2019s to learn the ways of the MTA.\u00a0\n\n    In order to take public transportation in New York City, you will need a MetroCard. If you do not have a MetroCard, whatever you do, do NOT try to jump the turnstiles. If you try to jump the turnstile, a little bald man named Phil will come and beat you up with a coconut on a stick. You will forever be traumatized and banned from taking the subway.\u00a0\n\n    Now, when taking the bus, you must greet the bus driver correctly. Ask them about their life. Make sure you get off the bus knowing the names of all 4 of their kids, otherwise you have failed.\u00a0\n\n    Pro tip for public transport speed: Bang on the glass 3 times and maybe give it a big, slobbery kiss. The more saliva left on glass, the faster you will get to your destination; the vehicle will be disgusted.\u00a0\n\n4. Driving in your car.\n\n    If you are unable to take public transportation because Phil got to you, learning how to drive like a New Yorker is very important.\u00a0\n\n    Unlike what most people think, driving rules in New York CIty are the same as they are everywhere else, so go ahead and make as many \u201cright on red\u201d turns as you want!\u00a0\n\n    There is only one important thing you need to know for driving in New York: when someone honks at you that is just their way of saying hello. A polite response requires you to replicate their honking pattern and add one large honk at the very end for flair. If you fail to do this, they are legally allowed to rear-end your car and you will have to pay them 30 New York Dollars (equivalent to 30 USD). Or, worse, Phil might come.\n\nI know this isn\u2019t everything that a New York tourist might need to know, so look out for more tips that may be coming your way soon. And remember: if you are a tourist, be sure to follow all of these rules exactly\u2014or else you will be either banned from New York or publicly executed in the execution chamber known as \u201cThe Statue of Liberty.\u201d Enjoy your stinky and sticky time here in New York City, and maybe just walk everywhere to avoid Phil!

    "content": "There's a lot of confusion out there surrounding the productivity of the company ThinkPad. \n\n\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t work properly,\u201d said some student, somewhere, probably. \u201cIt\u2019s just not close to as cool\u2014or useful\u2014as my Google Glass,\u201d said one unfortunate soul with too much time on their hands. \n\nA few students tested the quality of a ThinkPad by comparing the time it takes to turn on the computer to the time it takes for the elevators to get fixed. We were shocked to see that the ThinkPad beat the timing of fixing our school elevators by a whole minute. So, we, The Radish, have decided to turn to the internet, otherwise known as the best place to see whose opinion matches yours on important topics like which brand of computer should be considered a historical artifact. \n\nThe ThinkPad is \u201cthe most horrible excuse for a computer you can find on the first world market. It comes complete with reliable blue-screening and it\u2019s got structural integrity comparable to a multi-story cardboard tower. Mine bluescreened when I powered it up, because the infernal blast seared my hands and I dropped it in agony. The laptop dropped four feet and three inches, and the hard drive shattered instantly,\u201d Major Shmoopy described in a riveting interview from 2001. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not all bad, though,\u201d Major Shmoopy continued, \u201cif you lay down with the ThinkPad on you, you will become immune to fire. Also, think you can listen to music? Think again, buddy. The ThinkPad\u2019s sound system has such difficulty buffering that your Nickelback (or whatever it is that those kids listen to these days) will freeze before becoming so choppy you can't understand a darned thing! It ain\u2019t no computer, it\u2019s a glorified brick.\u201d  Apparently, he once gave up and decided to read his assigned book club book after waiting an hour to search up the Flashnotes on a ThinkPad. \n\nBeginning to understand that trying to use a \u201cThickPad\u201d is as productive as attempting to motivate a Tech student who failed to get into Stuy twice, many people have begun looking for better ways to use their ThinkPad computers. One such solution tested using a ThinkPad as a toaster oven. \u201cThe bread was burned and the cheese was on fire,\u201d Gordon Ramsay said after trying to make grilled cheese on a recently-activated computer.\n\nAnother idea was to use the laptop to heat homes unable to afford proper heaters. \u201cThe second we turned on the computer, it set fire to the walls and its battery ran out,\u201d my mother complained, packing her bags for our new apartment in Harlem. \n\nMaybe ThinkPad isn\u2019t meant to be used for its original purpose. Maybe ThinkPads were an April Fool\u2019s joke taken seriously. Well, at least someday in the far, distant future, when we won't have to use ThinkPads anymore, whenever we look at our burned, red, and crusty hands, we will remember these times we had writing essays slower on a computer than engraving the essay into stone.",

    "authors": ["matthieu-de-robles"],
    "issue": "april-2022",
    "content": "Broadway was put into a pause during the pandemic. NYC was dead for months. But, while the theaters collected dust, playwrights all around the country hunkered down in their little writing rooms, creating sensations well worth hundreds of dollars to see in person\u2014or for free if you get your rich Park Slope friends to illegally record a show for you. Anyway, now that Broadway\u2019s back, these new masterpieces are out, presented in theaters all across Broadway.\n\nHere are some of the Radish\u2019s favorites:\n* Guillotine by Kuroda Yoshito\n  Kuroda Yoshito makes his playwright debut with Guillotine, a story of the French Revolution from the perspective of a peasant.\n\n  But this tale puts a funky fresh spin on the French Revolution, having it take place during the 1960s! Experience Marie Antoinette telling the people to \u201clet them eat shrimp cocktails,\u201d or listen to the heartbreaking stories from the main character, \u00c9mile Leroy, perfectly complemented by electric guitars, keyboards, and the off-key singing of tie-dye hippies!\n\n* Stuffed in the Locker by William Shakespeare\n  William Shakespeare returns to the stage with Stuffed in the Locker, a story of a socially awkward high schooler on the road to discovering themself through a life-changing event that we won\u2019t spoil!\n\n  Now, the musical is being sued by the playwrights of Dear Evan Hansen, Be More Chill, and Heathers for being too similar, but even if you\u2019ve seen this exact premise a million times, we totally recommend seeing it again. It even features Hugh Jackman!\n* Underdog, Abovedog by Lin-Manuel Miranda\n  Lin-Manuel Miranda returns, again, to Broadway with Underdog, Abovedog, a story set in New York City, again, about a nobody who rises to prominence with hard work and dedication, again. Featuring Anthony Ramos, again, these songs will get stuck in everyone\u2019s heads, again, to the point of almost being annoying, again. But hey, if we can\u2019t talk about Bruno, and if we shouldn\u2019t throw away our shot, and we really wanna see how far we\u2019ll go, this musical offers the inspiration we all need in our lives.\n* Electric! by Tonies Tony\n  Tonies Tony, inventor of the Tony Awards, makes his debut on Broadway with Electric! Look, the story may be bland, but it stands out in its music. Rather than your typical showtunes, Electric! breaks expectations with all of its music in esoteric hyperpop, experimental hip-hop, and noise.\n\n  What a thrilling, creative artistic experience! No one\u2019s ever seen a musical that leaves the idea of showtunes behind! I mean, except for Hamilton, of course. Or Jesus Christ Superstar. Or Mamma Mia. You know what, next musical please.\n\n* Don\u2019t Get Me Started by Andrew Lloyd Webber\n  Andrew Lloyd Webber, seen as one of the greatest playwrights to exist, writes the final musical of his life, Don\u2019t Get Me Started. Don\u2019t Get Me Started really is something.\n\n  We\u2019re not sure what the plot is. All we can remember are the flashing lights, high pitched screams, and, if we remember correctly, anthropomorphic cats being tossed at the audience.\n\n  Don\u2019t Get Me Started is unforgettable in the weirdest way possible, but we definitely grew as people by the end of the show. Go see it. Or don\u2019t. To be fair, we don\u2019t even remember where the theater for this show is!",

    "authors": ["ilana-rahim-braden"],
    "issue": "february-2022",
    "content": "Here are some timeless, tried-and-true tactics to lure in all the boys!\n1. Get him to associate you with positive experiences, such as food.\n   Take forever to pick where to eat, and watch him get hungrier and hungrier (for you). Aggression is a good sign, this means he does not want anyone else in the way of his blooming connection with you(r food).\n2. Stay quiet.\n\n   Boys will be more likely to seek you out and explore further when you are quiet, because they do not like the rushes of people.\n   This is not necessarily due to shyness, quite the opposite could be true. So don\u2019t worry if shy boys aren\u2019t your type.\n3. I cannot stress this enough: **keep near food.**\n   Boys love food. He might even be more attracted to the food than you, but don\u2019t let this deter you. He\u2019s still curious about you, albeit distracted by the thoughts of his next meal.\n   Feed him. He will feel welcomed and will come back for more. If you end up not giving him anything on his return, he is very likely to become aggressive. Food tends to get the better of him.\n4. Show up for him in the average boy\u2019s favorite seasons: spring, summer, or early fall.\n\n   You will be hard-pressed to not find a boy out and about in these seasons; the weather will be nice, here in the Northern hemisphere.\n\n   Boys are most active at dusk and dawn. They function well in heat and become slothful in the chills of winter.\n5. Adorn new odors.\n\n   Lotions, deodorants, scented soaps and perfumes are all sure to catch a boy\u2019s attention. But the secret weapon is urine. The odors of urine are unique, interesting, and supremely attractive.\n   Boys have strong noses. The way to his heart is through scent. Your smells are crucial, do not neglect or dismiss their importance.\n6. Burn your garbage.\n\n   Boys love the smell of burning trash even more than regular trash. Don\u2019t worry about the flames, fire does not scare boys.\n\n   Boys are inherently curious and will likely seek out any smoke from the fire if the smell isn\u2019t enough.\n7. Don\u2019t want to seek him out?\n\n   Here\u2019s the easiest way. Keep your food in your tent. He\u2019ll be there for sure. Even better, eat in your tent.\n\n   A boy who comes to your tent is likely very used to humans and their food.\nGood luck with your boys, lovelies!",

    "title": "Birds Are Real",
    "authors": ["carmen-tan"],
    "issue": "december-2020",
    "content": "Word on the street is that birds don\u2019t exist. Understandable. I mean, them being government-made robots makes perfect sense. After all, haven\u2019t you noticed that they fly away when you run at them? Obviously a defense so you don\u2019t see their mechanics. Or, haven't you noticed how birds steal people\u2019s food? That would be explained if they were government drones; the government needs to take saliva samples to check if their plans are running smoothly. The food would then be given as a snack for the bird manager. And, if birds were government drones, coos and chirps could be from echolocation tests. Again, just to check that everything is as it should be. Birds being government drones would make sense. Recently, however, we were told that birds are real, live animals.\nCrazy, right? Birds are real, live animals\u2014like the ones that you see in your neighbor\u2019s house! Like dogs and children, birds are real, live animals. It\u2019s really crazy the amount of evidence brought to our attention to prove that birds are, in fact, real, live animals. Apparently, with the assumption that birds are real, live animals, birds are descendants of dinosaurs. Dinosaurs! Can you believe that? Those  great creatures which lived thousands of years ago. The creatures who all, allegedly, died when a meteor crashed onto the earth. Those are the ancestors of birds. Quite remarkable if you ask me. Really a bit unbelievable, but, heck, perhaps unbelievable enough to be true. I mean, we did have an annoying orange for a president and the election was still close. I\u2019d believe a lot nowadays. \nAs further evidence for why birds are real, live animals, people have been, allegedly, hunting birds and eating them. Apparently, they taste good. Because we are proving that birds are real today, I\u2019ll rule out the theory that they might just be meat-looking-and-tasting materials. So, this means these birds are \u201canimals\u201d that have bodies with meat\u2014and bones, apparently! This is absolutely crazy, but this must mean that birds are real. \nIn addition to that, there have been sightings of birds flying into windows and dying. Governmentally speaking, having creations unable to avoid a common building material is a bit inefficient.  So, I suppose that is another convincing argument that birds exist.\nWell, there you have it, folks! Birds exist. They\u2019re not random specks in the sky, nor are they pieces of government spy machinery. Cats, on the other hand, might be another story.",

    "title": "The Difference Between Valentine's Day Chocolate And Bombs",
    "authors": ["tobias-cen"],
    "issue": "february-2021",
    "content": "Valentine\u2019s day is always a special holiday for romantics and non-romantics alike. Whether you\u2019re enjoying time with your significant other, or venting online about how bad this holiday is because you\u2019re lonely, there\u2019s one constant that is never amiss in every Valentine\u2019s celebration: chocolate.\u00a0\n\nHowever, readers be warned: not all chocolates are made equal. Some are sweet, some are salty, and some are small explosives planted by the Illuminati (or maybe some other secret organization that plans world domination/damnation). Today, we\u2019ll show you how to tell the difference between a legit Valentine\u2019s chocolate box and an explosive device that could cause considerable harm to you and your property.\u00a0\n\nFirst, let\u2019s identify the choice of weapon that would likely be inside a chocolate assortment box. Dynamite is the most common explosive in chocolate boxes, though pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails have also been substituted in certain special cases.\u00a0\n\nA dynamite explosion, even a potential one, is no joke. I had the unfortunate experience of having my house decimated after a chocolate box was ignited in an uncalled-for \u201caccident.\u201d (To the neighbors who bought the chocolate box: if you\u2019re reading this, may the gods curse you and your offspring. As a result of your despicable actions, I lost my original, limited-edition Hatsune Miku body pillow that I bought last year off an eBay auction. It cost $500, more than your life will ever be worth.)\u00a0\n\nFrom here, we begin to analyze your chocolate box. If you\u2019re ordering a run-of-the-mill chocolate, like those boring Ferrero Rochers, you\u2019re safe. There are no commercially-produced explosives that fit inside such a small box. Trust me, I\u2019ve tried. You can enjoy your unimaginative and uninteresting chocolates in safety and boredom.\u00a0\n\nBut if you are more adventurous and order a <a href=https://www.li-lacchocolates.com/Valentine-Chocolate-Heart-Giant target=_blank rel=nopener noreferrer24-inch 5.7 lb chocolate box</a online at 4 AM after having a mental breakdown, you might be in for a bit more than you bargained for. These types of boxes are the perfect size for dynamite to be placed in, so watch out. Once you receive your package, it is best that you refrain from opening it in your house. Opening the package could ignite the explosive, immediately obliterating you and your original, limited-edition Hatsune Miku body pillow. (However, instances of chocolate boxes detonating instantly after opening are rare. A survey conducted in 2019 recorded only 2 out of 420 of such cases occurring in the United States, so it is more than likely that you won\u2019t be blown to smithereens just by opening the chocolate box.)\n\nOnce the box has been opened, peer inside to check its contents. If you see a pile of regular assorted chocolates, you're good to go! However, if you see a timer wrapped around a bundle of long, red sticks, you\u2019re screwed. A box with those contents is a chocolate box with dynamite in it 98.6% of the time.\u00a0\n\nEven in such dire circumstances, do not freak out. Depending on the timer, you could have between 28 minutes to 36 hours to dispose of the bomb. Just stay calm and call 911 to report the incident. Evacuate the area around the bomb immediately, and notify your neighbors to alert them of the threat. Unless those neighbors are my neighbors. Do not attempt to throw or destroy the box; you could harm yourself in doing so.\n\nRemember: the worst thing you could do is leave that monstrosity of a chocolate box unattended in a corner of your house. There\u2019s no definitive probability of buying a dynamite-rigged chocolate box, and if you\u2019re not aware of the threat, you could pay dearly for your ignorance.\u00a0\n\nHave fun and stay safe during this holiday! Valentine\u2019s day is dedicated to enjoying time with your significant other, no matter if they\u2019re real or a 2D character, like Hatsune Miku. It\u2019s not every day that we get the chance to rejoice and notice love, so appreciate the time you get to. Even if you\u2019re single, you can treat yourself with love, and always, always remember that you\u2019re never alone. Binge-watch romance movies, indulge in quality, non-explosive chocolate, and always know that Big Brother is watching over you.",

    "content": "Tired of wearing the same old stinky (and I mean stinky) sweats Monday through Friday? Wish to make yourself look stylish and chic in Chemistry as you cry whilst taking your midterm? Fancy forfeiting all mortal posse\u2014uh, I mean \u201csupporting your school\u201d\u2014fashionably and sustainably? If you do, as you really should, check out the new SGO Thrift Store, dedicated to making Brooklyn Tech the second-hand capital of New York\u2019s specialized high schools!\n\nThrifTech, known affectionately to technites as the LaF (Lost And Found), is SGO\u2019s latest plan to recover its financial losses from last year. The store (not to be confused with the actual SGO store) specializes in selling marvelously-curated outfits using neglected clothes retrieved from the school\u2019s numerous lost and found boxes. Some may claim these items are being stolen from unsuspecting students (due to the SGO being a bunch of greedy little stinkers), but this is far from the truth. ThrifTech is simply giving unappreciated items a second chance by selling them at a low low price of 115% of their retail value!\nAlthough these outfits have practical purposes, they often feel like artistic statements that fittingly represent our wonderful technite culture. One such fit I deeply resonated with was the aptly-named \u201cFoodie'' outfit from last month\u2019s collection, consisting of a faded gym hoodie top with unknown sauce stains and a pair of \u201cpizza\u201d-scented sweatpants, whose pockets were filled with dirty napkins and spork wrappers.\n\nAnother outstanding ensemble was the curiously-titled \u201cTeacher,\u201d which consisted of a lab coat covered in mysterious, non-threatening black stains, a pair of pristine slacks belonging to a concerningly-forgetful sub, and a complimentary backpack filled with ungraded math tests.\n\nFor their quality and absurd style, these outfits are cheap, too. The \u201cTech Foodie\u201d costs only $39.99 without tax, and with the end-of-term sale coming up, the deals will soon get even better.\n\nIn addition to selling clothes, ThrifTech occasionally auctions oddities that participating faculty have collected through annual \u201ccleaning.\u201d Auctions have sold everything from severely-dented water bottles to amputated SGO Teddy Bears used in rituals. Once, the store even held a special auction specifically for urine-tinted toilet lids collected between 1997 and 2018 from an assortment of boys\u2019 restrooms.\n\nThis week, I won a bone from their Halloween auction purported to be from the Forensic Lab\u2019s closet of actual human skeletons. I can\u2019t confirm if that\u2019s actually true, but, hey, as long as there\u2019s crunch I\u2019m happy to munch!\n\nAnd, thanks to the popularity of ThrifTech, Tech\u2019s thrifting community continues to expand. Tech\u2019s official Thrifting Club is aimed to surpass 200 members by next month, and the SGO has announced plans for ThrifTech collaborations with school clubs and extracurriculars.\n\nOn that note, we here at the Radish are proud to announce our partnership with LaF! Although we can\u2019t tell you what exactly is being sold, be on the lookout for your lost goods of the Radish and second-hand Radish merchandise, coming soon to ThrifTech; some of it might come directly from our retired executives! Till then, keep thrifting Tech, and please stop wearing those stinky hoodies. I can smell the stench through this paper.",

    "title": "Tongue Twisters Become Real Events",
    "authors": ["shai-chiapetta"],
    "issue": "may-2022",
    "content": "This past Friday, I was just walking down the beach, minding my own business, when I heard my friend Sally\u2019s voice. But she wasn\u2019t talking about her usual topics (mostly how bad her classes and teachers are). Instead, she was selling sea shells. When I asked her about it, she said that she had managed to make over $200 in sales in just the last four hours, despite the fact that there were sea shells all around the ground around her. It did strike me as odd that she had taken up this business seemingly out of the blue, and was somehow successful in it, but to me it seemed less surprising and more\u2026 simply \u201ccool.\u201d I forgot about it within a few hours.\nBut on Sunday, something similar happened. My friend Peter Piper called to say he had picked the wrong pack of pickled peppers and wanted to see if I wanted it. Now, I didn\u2019t even know that Peter liked peppers at all, let alone pickled ones. I told him no, but he should ask our mutual friend Stella, as she is known to like them.\nThat\u2019s when things really started. He said he wasn\u2019t able to reach her, because she had apparently dropped her cell phone down her entire apartment building\u2019s staircase- a staircase made of steel- and she lives on the seventh floor. So, yeah, no phone for Stella.\nNow, I was pretty weirded out. It could not be a coincidence that all of these tongue twisters were all coming true, could it? I decided to ask my friend, the woodchuck, the next day. It wasn\u2019t too hard to find him, as you don\u2019t normally see woodchucks chucking wood. I asked him about his experience, and he replied in his growly voice. Here was our conversation.\nMe: So, Mr. Woodchuck. How are you enjoying your newfound strengthened abilities?\nWC: Quite well, in fact. I\u2019ve been chucking as much wood as I can.\nMe: Well, sir, I am glad to hear you\u2019ve been having a good time. I\u2019d like to ask a bit about recent events.\nWC: Certainly.\nMe: How did you find out that you had suddenly gained this new ability?\nWC: Well, I, too, noticed that tongue twisters are becoming true. It all began when a bear I know, a real floofy guy by the name Fuzzy Wuzzy, suddenly seemed to have no hair. At that point I could assume he was quite un-fuzzy. Then I saw five frogs hopping down the river, pursued by, must have been forty or fifty fish. And it didn\u2019t help that we\u2019re in New York while all this is going down.\nMe: No, no it didn't.\nWC: So, after that I just had to give it a shot. I picked up a piece of wood and tried to chuck it, and what do you know, it worked!\nMe: Lovely.\nWC: Quite.\nMe: And\u2026 uh\u2026 so, how much wood does it turn out you can chuck?\nWC: Well, according to tradition, I can chuck just as much as I can. Not super helpful, huh? In practice, I can chuck about 17 pounds per hour.\nMe: Would you happen to know how this came to be? How all of these tongue twisters are coming true?\nWC: I haven\u2019t the slightest clue. But I do know that I love it. I would chuck all the wood if I could.\nThe woodchuck was wonderfully cheerful but not a bit helpful. I tried to ask another such living tongue twister, an ever-present pheasant I knew from middle school. We had a wonderful conversation about classical saxophone but ultimately got nowhere with regards to the issue at hand. I tried to ask some silly sheep, but all they could do was sleep, and if they ever woke up to hear a question they would start weeping until they fell asleep again.\n\nI asked Sally, as she had been the first person I was aware of to follow the tongue twisters, but she said she had seen others do it first.\nAs of now, the cause of this is unknown, but we are currently looking into the situation with all the effort we can. If anyone has any information, clues, or grip-top socks, please bring them to The Radish IMMEDIATELY. This is a crisis that could have unpredictable effects on society and we must stop the course of events while we still have the chance. Bye bright bygoer, by a-\nIt\u2019s too late.",

    "title": "The History of Music",
    "authors": ["ivy", "jacob-schles"],
    "issue": "february-2020",
    "content": "In the modern world, Music\u2122 is a basic necessity. Life without Music is practically unimaginable. But long ago, life without it was a given. There was no one bumping music from their car, no absolute bops in clubs, and dancing was a confusing sport rather than a fun activity. It was a dark, dark time. \n## Early Life \nThe year was 1914. World War One was just on the horizon. On April 12th, a child was born in Brooklyn. His name was Johnny Music, short for Jonathan Musically. As a child, little Johnny always loved playing with drumsticks, banging on walls and people (as drums hadn't been invented yet). Johnny was an ambitious child without a passion. His parents worried that he would never become something meaningful, even though they saw the embers of ambition within him. He just needed a spark. And sure enough, in 1938, after years of practicing and hard work, Johnny finally invented the Bongo. A simple machine, the first prototype was comprised of a hollowed-out wooden log, tape, saran wrap, and pants. In fact, half of Johnny's journey to discovery was spent trying to anthropomorphize his instruments. He gave up this goal after Disney copyrighted the human form in 1939, just days before Johnny was to release his new product, the Guitar-With-A-Mannequin-Head (the name of which was still in dispute). Soon, Johnny went on to pursue new concepts in music. \n## Musical Revolution \nMr. Music began to compose the first Songhjuihjmhupxerhihjexxkxkhkxuedarher, which was renamed to simply a \"song\" after the name was found to be unpronounceable. After many hard years of slaving away, inventing notes such as B, F, S, C++, and NF. Johnny finally completed \"If It's Your Birthday and You Know It Clap Your Hands.\" He had originally planned to call it \"If You're Happy and You Know It Clap Your Hands\", but that song was already copyrighted by Disney, despite not yet existing. Arguably Johnny's greatest achievement was when he realized he was able to multiply the Pythagorean Theorem by the Quadratic Formula, and when he subsequently used its result to discover the current musical staple of harmonies.\n## Musically's Inventions\nIn the years to come, he invented 16 more instruments. The non-human Guitar, the Trumpet, and the Flute (which he later upgraded to the far superior Kazoo) were the most successful. Prior to those, the Banjo, Mandolin, and Ukulele (early and poor prototypes of the Guitar that Johnny sold during the darker times of his life) had been released.\nThe Clarinet, the Trombone, the Trombone with Pants, and the Trombone with Better Pants were all instruments he invented during the 1960s for his new genre, Jazzz (later shortened to Jazz). Later in his career, he invented the Triangle (the shape, the instrument, and the romantic relationship), the Violin, The Bad Violin, Mayonnaise, The Cello, and his penultimate invention, the Scary Tambourine (non-scary versions appeared 37 years later).\n## Jonathan Musically and Xyler\nIt took Mr. Music 7 years until he got a new idea for an instrument. On a bright day in 1987, Johnny was on a hike with his cousin Xyler. As the legend goes, they were hiking through a forest owned by Jeff Bezos, which had recently had a massive wildfire raging through it. Bodies of dead animals and burnt trees surrounded the two. While Johnny was checking out a burnt tree, Xyler wandered around mindlessly. Johnny suddenly heard a strange yet melodic noise as Xyler tripped over the skeleton of a dead deer. The noise inspired Johnny in a way he hadn't known before. He spent nights upon nights perfecting his new instrument. And finally, he had done it. He called it the Xylophone. Of course, as most know it was a massive failure, leading to the end of Johnny's career. For now.\n## Final Years\nBut the Xylophone was not his only failure. As many have already inferred from Mr. Musically's last name, in 2014 he invented musical.ly. This led to his assassination by the infamous Tommy TikTok, two years before he invented his own similar platform. TikTok was then assassinated by John Wilkes Booth as revenge for assassinating Mr. Music, but the deed had already been done. Thus the legacy of Johnathan Musically was forgotten, and at age 100, little is known about his enigmatic life. ",

    "title": "Free Donut Guys Not Creepy, They're Just Really Nice",
    "authors": ["kiran-berger"],
    "issue": "quarantine-issue-one",
    "content": "This school year, Brooklyn Tech saw an increase in peculiar events and patterns. Obviously, the big one was the fake bomb threat. It caused chaos throughout the neighborhood and doubled LIU-Brooklyn\u2019s student body for the day. What made that worse for some people was the presence of some free donut guys. That\u2019s right: for one whole day in October, there was a group of men near Rocky\u2019s. They were holding Bibles, wearing blue suits, and trying to give handouts about The Gideons International organization. We found it really culty. But only one unfairly infamous group has the right to a repeated presence at Tech. This purposeless, nameless group shows up about once bi-weekly. Needless to say, it is pretty suspicious to students. However, our investigative reporters at The Radish have infiltrated their organization, gone through their chain of supply, reviewed their mission statement, and interviewed their staff. Now please, thanks to the work done\u2014and sacrifices made\u2014by our investigative staff, please read our great investigative report:\u00a0\n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen it for yourself yet, every two weeks or so, a group of adults hand out free Dunkin\u2019 Donuts donuts to Technites. They are usually on the side of Tech closest to Rocky\u2019s. Many Tech students have been speculative of their donut motives. Some say the donut men are trying to recruit people for their religion, whereas others think they are brainwashing them into transferring to Stuy. Nevertheless, whoever we asked, we never heard anyone speculate that they might just be nice people, trying to lift us up during the stressful school year. That\u2019s why we decided to concretely explain their motives.\u00a0\n\nOur first move: tracking their supply chain. This proved easy enough; we were able to trace back to the Atlantic Avenue Dunkin\u2019 Donuts. We briefly interviewed an employee who was working when they most recently picked up donuts for Tech. Here\u2019s a short excerpt from that interview, which was cut for brevity:\u00a0\n\nUs: Did you notice anything weird about the group? Did they have any weird behaviors or tendencies when picking up their donuts?\n\nEmployee: Besides the fact that hardly anyone buys $500 donuts every two weeks, not really. They were pretty normal and polite to me and my colleagues. Actually, one time they tipped us 200%. Actually, can that be off the record? I might\u2019ve stolen that from the tip jar when I went to empty it.\u00a0\n\nUs: Yeah sure, that\u2019ll be off the record. Don\u2019t worry.\u00a0\n\nSo, not only is the donut crew really nice to Tech students, but to everyone\u2014even if they steal tips from their fellow employees. But here at the Radish, we always seek the absolute truth. We dug even deeper. We decided to interview the donut people the next chance we got: 8:25 AM one day, the most recent donut people appearance. Here\u2019s an excerpt from that interview:\u00a0\n\nUs: Hi, we\u2019re doing investigative work for our student publication about your\u2026 handouts.\u00a0\n\nDonut Guy: No worries! Ask any questions you want, kid. We\u2019re an open book.\n\nUs: Well, that\u2019s the thing. We don\u2019t know much about you. Don\u2019t worry, though. We only want to know a few things, like, how much do you spend a week on donuts?\n\nDonut Guy: We spend around $500 a week.\n\nUs: And who pays?\n\nDonut Guy: We pay out of pocket.\n\nUs: Oh wow. So, besides donuts, do you hand out anything else? Any pamphlets, drinks, miniature holy books, belief systems?\u00a0\n\nDonut Guy: Nah kid, just donuts, good vibes, and a smile.\n\nUs: Oh I see you, so you put stuff inside the donut. Smart.\n\nDonut Guy: Nah, it\u2019s just the donuts, man.\n\nUs: Then why do you hand out the donuts?\u00a0\n\nDonut Guy: We do it for a variety of reasons. Our biggest, and most obvious, reason? We love to help the students, who might not have had a good breakfast. Also, we get free breakfast too! Haha, donuts are the best breakfast!\n\nAnother Donut Guy: We\u2019d also rather give donuts to students than cops, who get way too much attention for their love of donuts. But personally? For me it\u2019s all about getting to enjoy the scent of garbage and scaffolding outside of Tech. It\u2019s just such a delightful and healthy way to spend my mornings!\u00a0\n\nYet Another Donut Guy Wearing a Sticky, Sweet-Smelling Overcoat: Also, free donuts!\n\nThis is why we of The Radish believe that it\u2019s safe to inform people the donut guys are nothing to fear! While many believe they have ulterior motives, we find our extensive investigation to show the donut guys are not creepy, just really nice dudes.\u00a0",

    "content": "Before I start this article, can I just say how much I am in love with the 1997 Windows XP computer I found on the street this February? It runs Internet Explorer, my new favorite web browser. Since I found it, I haven\u2019t used any other computer or browser to get the latest news and information. So far, everything seems to be accurate. With that out of the way, let's renegade like that Charli D'amelio girl into the rest of this article. \nAs of last Friday, March 13th, new COVID-19 rules have closed schools to protect the safety of students and staff. \nIf you didn\u2019t already know, COVID-19 is a new virus. Discovered two months ago, in January, it has the same symptoms as the flu, but not quite. Still, it doesn\u2019t look like this virus is going to be a big deal; schools will be open by the end of April!\nTo get some first-hand insight on what\u2019s going on for students with closed schools, I went outside for the first time in a month. I interviewed some kid I saw from my window making what I think is called a \u201cMusical.ly.\u201d Internet explorer hasn\u2019t released Musical.ly yet, so I doubt it\u2019s good or popular. \nWhen asked the question, \u201cHow do you feel about schools closing due to the new coronavirus?\u201d Steve Dubnut, an 8th grader, answered with, \u201cI mean, it\u2019s happened once already, so I guess it\u2019s not so bad. Wait what do you mean \u2018new\u2019 coronavirus? It\u2019s been around for over a year. Also, I\u2019m not in 8th grade. I\u2019m in high school. Anyway, can you please go away? I just posted a Tik Tok.\u201d\nI don\u2019t really know what he meant when he said that the virus had \u201cbeen around for over a year.\u201d Internet Explorer hasn\u2019t told me anything about this virus being a year old, and I trust my beautiful new computer more than \u201cSteve Dubnut,\u201d if that\u2019s really their name. Also, schools have never been closed before, so I think that this kid is a little out of it if you know what I\u2019m saying.\nAnyway, stay safe everyone! This is a dangerous virus, but I know we can get through it! Just wait for April, it will all be over by then! Remember to wash your hands and wear a mask. \nFinally, I\u2019d like to take one last moment to thank my new Windows XP computer. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to write this article, let alone learn all about the new trends going on such as \u201cVine\u201d and the \u201cmannequin challenge,\u201d without it. I would be clueless without it. \n",

    "issue": "december-2021",
    "content": "Are you an aspiring British person from the 1830s?\u00a0 Do you love taking land and being a complete plague on society? Do you want to make people pay 1000s of dollars for walls thinner than Papa John\u2019s pizza? You could be a great landlord!\nWhat kinds of landlords are there? Well, there are the ones who fix everything (including their marriage) with wd-40 and duct tape. The ones who are incapable of not only making it up the stairs to your bathroom but also can\u2019t count high enough to find your apartment. And there are the ones who are nice enough to make you buy the sealant to fix the walls that they broke \u201cfixing\u201d your sink.\nUnfortunately, as a landlord, you\u2019ll come in contact with lots of people, many with lots of opinions of how much sealant it takes to fill the hole their (idiot) child made or on how YOU should fix the gas to the stove that THEIR (still idiot) child drowned in water. Then after fixing this problem (possibly through illegal methods we don\u2019t judge), you get to decide how to enact your revenge through the power of the pocketbook. Choosing (1) how much you want to increase the mean price of NYC rent even higher than it already is and (2) how many times a year you want to find a new group of tenants to torture help.\nDo you wanna know what kind of landlord you\u2019ll be? Then take this quiz to find out! (and give us ad revenue so we can continue to appease our landlords, some get so angry when you say you\u2019re keeping radishes for some reason.)\n1. Do you enjoy making money by having people live in your house?\n   A. Yes! (+1)\n   B. Yes!! (+3)\n   C. No! (-1)\n   D. Eh, only on Tuesdays. (+1/7)\n2. Has there ever been a time when you\u2019ve liked making money very easily?\n   A. Yes! (+1)\n   B. No! (-2)\n   C. I don\u2019t care about money. I am an upstanding citizen of society and don\u2019t believe in material gains because they promote toxicity and flexing, which is a very bad part of society.\u00a0 (-42)\n   D. If it\u2019s easy money I\u2019ll do it; it\u2019s easy and funny. (+7.77)\n3. Do you believe in being a good samaritan and being nice?\n   A. What\u2019s a samaritan? (+40)\n   B. What\u2019s being nice? (+60)\n   C. Yes! (+10)\n   D. I\u2019m so nice I broke your toilet just so I can fix it. (+80)\n4. Was there ever a time when you took someone in and made them pay rent?\u00a0 How did you feel about that experience?\n   A. Yes and I have to say I should\u2019ve just kicked them out after they got a job. (+2)\n   B. Better: I let them live in my spare house for free\u2014until I watched that one episode of Spongebob and it made me realize I was being taken advantage of.\u00a0 I then promptly made him get a job and find that dime for me. (+2.01)\n   C. No, I like being alone. (-5)\n   D. Wasn\u2019t the point of this quiz supposed to tell me what kind of landlord I am? (-15)\n5. I ran out of ideas so this is a freebie, do you like taking care of people?\n   A. Yes! (+2)\n   B. HAHAHAHAHA oh you\u2019re serious\u2026 (+2)\n   C. I took care of people before, they\u2019re six feet under now :)\u00a0 (+2)\n   D. I pay off Warren Buffet\u2019s mortgage, that\u2019s how giving I am (+2)\n6. Can you fix things like Bob the Builder?\n   A. I can fix it! (+25)\n   B. Nope, too lazy. (+25)\n   C. Duct tape and WD-40 works like magic, right? (+50)\n   D. Is Bob some type of tool? (+0)\n7. Can you fix household appliances like a toilet?\n   A. Yes!\u00a0 I know how to be a handyman! (+20)\n   B. This sounds like the previous question (-15)\n   C. No I just flood the apartment with water and sewage (+10)\n   D. I don\u2019t know (+2)\nWow, you were able to finish this quiz! Now add up all your point totals to find out what kind of landlord you are.\n124.7 or higher: You make the perfect landlord! Go find some contracts to sign and some plungers to toilet (or is it toilet to plunger)!\nBetween 33 and 127.7: You may not make that good of a landlord yet. Why don\u2019t you try out being a seacount instead?\nLess than 33: Why did you do this quiz in the first place? Go grab a working belt and be an accountant or something.\n",

    "authors": ["aramie-ewen"],
    "issue": "february-2022",
    "content": "I vividly remember sitting on my nonna\u2019s back porch, eating a crusty slice of her old carpet. Every Sunday, our family would all get together and rub our grimy shoes all over that snugly-fit floor blanket that also keeps the bottoms of your feet from getting cold. We didn\u2019t have much shoe crust to contribute back then, but we did our best. And life was good.\nI was reminded of these beautiful times this afternoon, enjoying my luxuriant 10th period lunch. Sitting in the cafeteria, I wiped the crust from the table with a fashionably-wrinkled pocket napkin. But, to my surprise, the glorious crumb collection fell uselessly to the bare, checkered floor without a struggle. That was the moment the idea struck me.\u00a0\n\nAt that moment, I was inspired like crust is inspired to crumble off of shoes and old food in the presence of a quality carpet. What if wiping crumbs off cafeteria tables could be a struggle, I wondered? What if our cafeteria tables could be as delectably grimy as my grammy gram\u2019s old rug? BTHS students surely have more shoe crust than my family ever did.\n\nWell, not only can our tables become carpeted and crispy, so can the rest of our school! We could begin the Carpeting of Tech with every bolted down item, such as cafeteria tables, desks, and similar table-like surfaces. This will include toilet seats, stairway railings, and the shelves of the vending machines. With such a gentle, noncommittal start, I\u2019m sure people will have no problem accepting carpeting into other areas of their lives.\n\nThe cafeteria almost always runs out of food by my time in line, but with the never-ending supply of grime from the soles of BTHS students\u2019 shoes that could be collected on these fitted carpets, I\u2019ll be able to find a snack anywhere I go. So, get out there, rub the slimy soles of your shoes over those cafeteria tables, the backs of those first floor auditorium chairs, and, perhaps if you\u2019re feeling adventurous, the stairway handrails. The floor is the limit.",

    "content": "\u201cWhy is my Citi Bike screaming this time,\u201d I wondered, biking down an unexpectedly gentle hill.\n\nToday\u2019s scream was less distorted than normal. Normal screams sound like a broken chain with a higher pitch, kind of like the bell of a Citi Bike. I could hear why my Citi Bike was screaming today, without any prodding why.\nThe bike was shrieking at me: \u201cDo your laundry!\u201d I did my laundry yesterday. Obviously, that wasn\u2019t what was really bothering my bike.\nThen again, what if I forgot something at the bottom of my laundry bin? It\u2019s not out of the question. I can be very forgetful. The other day, another Citi Bike kept shouting: \u201cYou bike-brain, where are you biking to?\u201d I kept forgetting to answer, and then they would ask again.\nI was worried I might be wrong, but I shouted back: \u201cI did my laundry!\u201d Every single time the bike would shout, I\u2019d reply. If I didn\u2019t, who knows how much louder things could have gone?\n\u201cWhy are you-\u201d someone biking past said.\n\n\u201cI DID MY LAUNDRY YESTERDAY!\u201d People who own bikes don\u2019t get it.\nI tried asking the Citi Bike what was really bothering them since I did my laundry. Besides, the bike really shouldn\u2019t have been worried anyway; bikes normally don\u2019t wear clothes, especially not my clothes. Interestingly enough, the bike didn\u2019t care to respond. They went silent for the first time that ride. I docked the bloke and walked away.\n\nOn my way back from Starbucks, I got a normal-screaming Citi Bike. For some reason, that day I decided to scream with the bike.\n\nSomeone started biking next to me. \u201cThis is an unexpectedly gentle hill,\u201d they mentioned. This really was barely a hill at all. Aggressively normal, almost-flat land. \u201cIt\u2019s annoyingly flat, is that why you\u2019re screaming?\u201d\nI stopped screaming with the bike to respond, \u201cNah, I was just keeping my bike\u2019s scream company.\u201d Embarrassingly, the bike wasn\u2019t screaming anymore.\nThey looked at me like I was the crazy one. At least I don\u2019t start talking to strangers.\nMaybe Citi Bikes just like specifically annoying me. Nobody else I talk to seems to have this problem. They probably just hate me. Maybe I should stop using Citi Bike to avoid situations like this.\n\nBut I\u2019d stop using Citi Bike if I wanted to. I\u2019m lucky enough to have a bike. Whatever. I can deal with the bikes\u2019 complaints. Citi Bike is faster than getting a bike lock.",

    "content": "As all Tech heads are experiencing, Gym class is now completely online. That\u2019s right, no more sharing locks or hurriedly stuffing gym clothes into the back of our bags. Now, we all have definitely been exercising from home, creating our own workouts, and finding them online. Our teachers have even been so nice as to encourage us by making these workouts mandatory for a passing grade. For some of us, they even made a colorful, complex log system to record our workouts and create elaborate reflections on them. \n\nPersonally, I am reaping the benefits of these workouts. The daily workouts and cardio exercises have most definitely placed me at the peak of the human physical condition. In fact, last night, when typing up the reflection for my workout, my computer repeatedly only autocorrected to \u201cI\u2019m shredded now\u201d. Despite my commitment to completing these workouts, I wondered if any Tech kids would be able to fool their gym teachers with their logs. \n\nTo test my theory, I enlisted top medical experts in the kinesiology field, to see their predictions of my physical fitness based purely on workout logs. I sent them each a copy of a workout log I made up for this experiment, which had three workouts per day. All of the doctors had similar responses, claiming I was a unique spectacle of the human condition. Based on their responses, I concluded that anyone could be fooled by a fake workout log. So, to finish off this investigative report, here are some of the responses I got from the medical experts I reached out to:\n\n- 51 said that I would have only 1-3% body fat. \n\n- 43 said that I would not have only 1, but rather 2 blood types. \n\n- 33 said that I would have the flexibility of a rubber band. \n\n- 26 said that I would have the heart stamina of a professional marathon runner.\n\n- 4 said that I would double my bone count.\n\n- 29 said that I would develop a bulletproof, turtle-like shell that I could slide around on.\n\n- 35 said that if I continued this workout for another 2 weeks, I would have the sense of smell and maneuverability of a young rabbit.\n\n- 1 said nothing, but I think that was because it was actually a cantaloupe.\n",

    "content": "\u201cNothing but a capitalist advertising campaign could possibly stay in the sky that long,\u201d I thought to myself one day, staring at the moon in a non-creepy way.\n\nSeriously, only some insane capitalist venture could stay relevant this long. The moon has been a popular symbol among the sky-enthused for centuries, and, undoubtedly, the moon has used its gravity during that time. But how does the moon use that influence? To sell.\n\nOf course, on its own, the moon\u2019s prevalence is fine. Advertisements become pop sensations all the time. I have no problem with capitalism. How could I?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n![Moon face](https://storage.googleapis.com/radish-2bd31.appspot.com/old-assets/moon-man.jfif Moon face)\n\nThat face though. Just look at that face: the prime image of a human. Looking at the moon\u2019s face and saying you aren\u2019t being sold something is impossible. The moon sits there, looking down at us. Looking at the moon for long enough, you\u2019ll see the marketing genius: the moon is trying to sell us that lovely face. Looking at the moon, beauty standards suddenly make sense.\n\nEver since the start of the moon, people have been expected to have perfectly spherical, grey faces. We are told we should have nice, grey, circular faces with eyes sunken so deep you can\u2019t see. We are expected to keep our heads shaven and our faces round. The moon\u2019s image is presented as the only way to be attractive.\n\nThe moon set the expectation that we keep our faces in an eternal \u201csmolder,\u201d or some other mildly disgusted face, like the one it has. But the only thing I\u2019m disgusted at here? The unrealistic expectations. And, honestly, I\u2019ll say it: smooth, globular, dusty heads aren\u2019t for me.\u00a0\n\nYet that face advertisement stays in the sky. Sure, there was that one race to try taking down the moon in 1969, but \u201cscientists\u201d just poked the thing. There have been no real actions.\n\nWhat a shame! Ending this horrible symbol\u2019s reign would be easy. All we have to do is remove the little string holding the moon to that blue stuff. Since the moon is so tiny, someone could just pocket it and the symbol would be gone.\u00a0And, while scientists tend to disagree with that, they stare at the moon in a creepy way. Can you really trust them?\n\nI mean, look how easy this could be:\n\n![How to take down the moon](https://storage.googleapis.com/radish-2bd31.appspot.com/old-assets/cut-the-moon.png How to take down the moon)\n\nSo why not take down the moon? The advertising campaign has run a full course; everyone has a face\u2014even if none could be as round, as ethereal, as powdery as the moon\u2019s. The moon only serves to taunt us. The advertising has gone too far.",

    "content": "Hey, you look like an easily-influenced person with a large amount of spare money! Are you interested in helping out your favorite school newspaper? If the answer is yes, which it\u2019d better be, check out our amazing fundraising plan: merchandise!\nWe are now selling The Radish mugs. You won\u2019t find anything made of root vegetables better than these mugs to drink your coffee\u2014or your covfefe\u2014out of. They are made with 100% organic, all-natural materials. A special thank you to our cup farmer, Hank Harrison, for growing the radishes.\nOkay, now, I\u2019m not supposed to say this, but just between you and me, our tote bags aren\u2019t as all-natural and organic as the mugs. Only about 75% of the human skin we use to make them is from a natural source; the rest is synthesized in a lab. 50% off if you bring us a dead body and an egg with your purchase.\nBut if you already have a lot of tote bags (perhaps you\u2019ve been doing some sewing on your own time), you can buy our t-shirts! We have small, extra small, really small, outrageously small, and so-small-it-doesn\u2019t-actually-exist all in stock! Get them fast; these shirts are selling like hotcakes, that is to say, only in bakeries. We\u2019ve already sold out of the print with Radimir Rootin kicking The Survey. Shirts may not fit people bigger than 5 radish standard.\nNow, for some reason, an easily-influenced person like you may wonder why we\u2019re doing this fundraiser. Obviously, with quality this high, we\u2019ll raise more than enough to print out another batch of articles with advertising money alone. But we have bigger plans than a printed magazine. Printing may be suitable for The Survey, if they ever release anything, but not us. We want to have the next issue transcribed into multiple languages for a larger host of enjoyers, so we\u2019ll be doing print runs in Spanish, Mandarin, Dutch, Latin, Mesopotamian Cuneiform, and Voynich Manuscript-ian. We also want to paint the issue onto the sides of the school, which will cost considerably more than normal printing, for some reason. If we have some extra after that, we\u2019ll build a golden statue of our real club president, Radimir Rootin, outside of the east entrance to the building.\nI hope you are looking forward to the amazing merchandise and school paint job that\u2019s coming your way soon! I know I am. So, if you want to gaze upon a solid gold statue of Radimir Rootin while you sip your coffee out of an authentic Radish mug (coffee not included), just head over to [http://theradishbths.netlify.app/merch/fundraiser/amogus/](http://theradish.nyc/merch/fundraiser/amongus/) and buy our merch today!\nAdditional merch is detailed on our poster.",

    "content": "You ever have a burning hatred for someone, an absolute fire inside directed at one individual? Well, in my case, this individual is Gary. I HATE Gary. He farts a lot, he smells, and I HATE him. Ever since he came into my life, he\u2019s been messing everything up. Some people say that he\u2019s trying to be a good person but I disagree. I can tell he has some malicious intentions deep inside that dull head of his. Ever since my friends have known Gary they\u2019ve liked him more. It was instant. And they\u2019ve been wanting to spend more time with him than ME. What's wrong with ME? I\u2019m great. Gary isn\u2019t great: Gary SUCKS. I don\u2019t get why he\u2019s better-liked. He\u2019s stupid. You know sometimes I think the only one who wants to spend time with me IS Gary. He keeps me up ALLLLLLL night. I hate him and his stupid face. Did you know he has a really stupid face? It\u2019s all blank and lifeless. It\u2019s like he has no thoughts in that dumb brain of his. You know, \\*I\\* have thoughts. \\*I\\* am not blank and lifeless. And \\*I\\* don\u2019t have a dumb stupid little smile that can make tears come out of someone else\u2019s eyes. You know what else is wrong about Gary? He SMELLS. He smells BAD. Like he pooped his pants or something. Every time he walks by I get a whiff of the 9-year-expired barbecue sauce I found in my grandpa\u2019s fridge last summer. How did that even get in there? How long does it take for barbecue sauce to expire? Why does Gary smell so much like barbecue sauce?Another thing about Gary is that he only eats three foods\u2014and none of them are good. He eats like really mushy peas. Like he gets a bowl of deliciously fresh peas from the microwave, and they just get mushed into oblivion. Like what the HELL is up with that? Terrible horrible terrible. He sucks. I hate him. Eat some normal food for once. Like barbecue sauce. The WORST part about Gary\u2019s dumb stupid dumb existence, though, is that he cannot do ANYTHING for himself. He can\u2019t make himself food, he can\u2019t do homework without slobbering all over it, and WORST OF ALL, he can\u2019t even dress himself. Like, what the hell? I mean I\u2019ve seen terrible fashion but come on man. Put on some goddamn pants for yourself.Overall I just HATE Gary. He\u2019s STUPID, he\u2019s UGLY, he SMELLS, and worst of all he\u2019s a useless DUNCE. Anyway I\u2019m starting to rethink asking my parents for a baby brother and I DEFINITELY regret asking them to name him Gary. What a stupid name, right?",

    "title": "School Re-Applies Asbestos In Bathrooms",
    "authors": ["noah-mack"],
    "issue": "volume-2",
    "content": "Because of earlier events in the year involving vandalism and smoking in bathrooms at Tech, the school established new policies limiting the bathroom freedoms of students who needed to go during class time. This policy included an adult outside the bathroom to time the students who enter. Their motivation behind this was probably to deter students from smoking and vaping by limiting their time spent in the bathroom. However, students could easily spend long stretches of time in the bathroom by explaining that they suffered from gastrointestinal discomfort. What makes this excuse especially convincing is the uneasiness towards the exchange of ideas regarding fecal matter, but also the frequent outbreaks of salmonella in the school lunches. Ultimately, the policies were discontinued when students supposedly bullied the principal into scrapping the project.\nSome time later the school presented an innovative solution to the aforementioned problem. After removing a recently uncovered repository of asbestos from one of the locker rooms, the school found that the EPA\u2019s (Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s) reactions were surprisingly lax. School officials soon realized that placing asbestos in the bathrooms would encourage students to spend as little time as they possibly can in the room.\n\nConsidering that asbestos is a particularly infamous carcinogen, people posed some interesting questions towards the school.\n\u201cLiterally like what the hell is your logic behind this?\u201d deadpanned one student.\nStrangely the school has yet to reply to any questions. However, despite a lack of direct answers, the administration created an anonymous sample poll among students, posing the question: \u201cWould you like asbestos or no asbestos?\u201d Responses are limited to \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cYes.\u201d The results were unanimous: \u201cYes.\u201d Some academic individuals commented on the poll\u2019s glaring reminiscence of communist elections. And so, with no clear idea of weather or not the student body was in opposition to the appliance of asbestos in bathrooms, Tech posted an announcement on its webpage saying that students could now bring in parental consent forms allowing them to use an alternative bathroom without asbestos, conveniently located in an open space on the 10th floor. A more in-depth description of this restroom was recently published on the BTHS website:\n> \u2026 The alternative restrooms are to be used by one student at a time \u2026 an adult will be posted in the restrooms to closely monitor the student for the duration of a student\u2019s time in the restroom \u2026 the restrooms will feature one toilet, one sink, a trash receptacle, and appropriate restroom articles, i.e. toilet paper, a paper towel container, stocked with a generous daily complement of 0 rolls of paper towel, and liquid soap dispenser \\[which will have such a miniscule amount of soap left that you\u2019ll be stuck there at the sink for a painful amount of time, desperately squeezing the pump while a couple pathetic lumps of bubbles are squirted out into your naked palm until you have just enough foam to lightly spread over only one side of your hand. So you begrudgingly dip your soap-deprived hands back under the stream of water but you have to press down on the push-faucets again because the water already stopped coming out, so you finish up and you\u2019re about to leave but then you realize that there are no more goddamn paper towels in the box so you have to wipe your wet hands on your pants but then your hands are still a bit damp and you exit the bathroom having been grotesquely deceived].\nThe Tech administration is still in the collection phase of the asbestos installation, preparing advertisements for the daily announcements, BTHS homepage, and, of course, Craigslist. As to the fact that nobody has yet to view neither the daily announcements nor the BTHS homepage in the past year, the Radish would like to issue a plea to the people of Craigslist: Please, avoid the selling and purchase of BTHS brand asbestos.",

    "title": "Seeker of Success: Physical Education Extra Credit",
    "authors": ["amara-chowdhury"],
    "issue": "quarantine-issue-two",
    "content": "Jocks and nerds looking for extra credit, rejoice! During the next two weeks, you can get a guaranteed perfect grade in gym. However, there are risks to getting this insane profit.\nIf you desire the challenge, go down to the basement and walk into the dean\u2019s office. Any office will suffice, as long as the door is open and you can see a lady with a streak of white in her dark, curly hair and eyes that shine like crystals. You should be able to spot her immediately because she sits in a chair near the far wall, as seen from the door.\nBefore stepping into the room, knock against the surface of the door with three quick taps. She will look up, give you a nod, then shift her gaze back to her computer. She has given you permission to enter. Walk in without this rite and her eyes will flash brighter than before, permanently blinding you.\nWalk into the room until you come to a green-tinted full-length locker, one that definitely wasn\u2019t in the room before today. Don\u2019t touch it, but instead, in the quietest voice you can manage, say, \u201cExcuse me.\u201d The office woman will hear you and turn her head like an owl in your direction. Ignore the cracking sound her neck makes. A polite smile will spread on her face. As quickly and concisely as possible, ask for extra credit for Physical Education. Do not stutter or pause, for when her mouth is open so wide, her teeth become as thin and sharp as needles.\n\nIf what you\u2019ve said satisfied her, her mouth will close into a thin line. She will fish a tiny, silver key from the biggest key chain you\u2019ve ever seen. Hold out your hand and she will drop the key into your palm.\nUse the key to open the locker, turning it to the right until you hear a faint click. At this point, you should pray to every deity you know of. There is no going back now.\nHold your breath. When you enter, you don\u2019t want anything to go up your nose, because when you walk through, you'll be submerged in water. Swim through or wait long enough and the water levels will lower. Hopefully, you can hold your breath that long.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve survived the water, you\u2019ll find yourself in a study. It will have a desk, chair, and a couple of bookcases. You\u2019d think that there\u2019d be a secret door behind the bookcases. You wouldn\u2019t be wrong. But those doors lead to nowhere you want to end up, so ignore them and the leaden thuds against wood.\n\nPush the desk to the side, and you will see a trapdoor. While it looks heavy and made of thick wood and metal, you should be able to lift it easily. Jump down before you have more regrets.\n\nAt the bottom, it will be completely dark. You may hear some whispering or similar noises, but you should focus on what you can see. After a few minutes, the darkness should lift, and you will see a running track ahead of you. It stretches on as far as you can see.\n\nYou will hear a deep voice as you get closer. It will get louder as you realize you can actually hear bits of what it\u2019s saying. It\u2019s speaking in every tongue, human or otherwise. But it\u2019s always the same thing, no matter who you are: \u201c...is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult\u2026\u201d You\u2019ve done this before, so you\u2019ve got it in the bag, right? Well, you shouldn\u2019t be so proud. The rules down here are very different. \u201c...begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start\u2026\u201d Go on, get into a running position! It\u2019s only so long before it starts. \u201c...gets faster\u2026 after you hear this signal.\u201d\nYou hear a shrill beep echo, and you can hear some\u2026 distressed screeching? At this point, you don\u2019t even know what\u2019s real.\n\u201cRemember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible.\u201d\nThe audio is getting clearer, but it keeps getting interrupted by a very loud screech. It seems to be coming from the walls, which are so far away you can\u2019t see them. The only thing that confirms their existence is an echo completely independent from the initial noises.\n\u201c...your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.\u201d\nRun. Run as far as your legs can carry you. Then run more. Do not slow down. If you slow or stop, you\u2019ll have bigger problems than a side stitch.\nThe voice overhead announces numbers, one after another. For each number, there\u2019s a screech or growl, followed by the noise of what you hope is nails on a chalkboard. At one or two, it\u2019s bearable. The bigger the numbers get, the louder the sounds get.\n\nDon\u2019t turn back. There are things chasing you, and the consequence for looking at them would be far worse than stopping.\n\nYour legs will feel like they\u2019re on fire from the pain, but your worries are just beginning. As you continue, your path may thin out, or holes may appear. Just be careful you don\u2019t fall off the edge, because if you thought the monstrosities behind you were terrible, it will be even worse to understand they\u2019re just the minions.\n\nJust run in a straight line, and don\u2019t stop\u2014even if you see malicious glints of light from the walls that seem to be closing in. Even when parts of the ceiling start falling right beside you. Even when the most ear-shattering scream comes from nearby, rattling you to your very core. Just run.\n\nBy the quadruple digits, you shouldn\u2019t even be feeling pain, but rather deep-seated exhaustion and a sense of apathy. You\u2019ll start to question everything, from why you went here, to this school, to why you came here, to this demonic realm. And none of your questions will have clear answers.\nYou\u2019re now on the last leg of your adventure and I have a confession: I lied to you. The track isn\u2019t straight. It\u2019s a circle, and you have been running the same path while those terrible things have been chasing you. The only way to leave this behind is to deny your way of thinking.\n\nYou do know why you came to this school: its name and prestige.\n\nYou do know why you came up to this challenge: you thought your grades were more valuable than your life.\n\nWhy do you even care about grades? That\u2019s because good grades get you into a good college, which gets you a good job, which gets you a good family, which is supposed to bring you happiness.\n\nWhy do so many steps for something you can try to achieve right now?\nThink about what you love most in the world. Is it your parents? Your dog? Your crush? Your report cards, with every grade a gleaming A?\nNow dig deeper. Why? Because as soon as you can accept what truly drives you, the quicker you can leave this worn path of your mind with all its doubts and fears.\n\nOnce your mind is clear and tranquil, you\u2019ll stop hearing those horrible noises. As the path continues, you can walk without fear. After you\u2019ve caught your breath, though it may be eons later, you\u2019ll come to a door. Open it and you\u2019ll find yourself back in the study from before, but it will have changed. Maybe the windows are open, or maybe the room is cleaner. Maybe there are no books, more books, or art on the walls. It\u2019s reflecting you, your goals, hopes, and aspirations. Hopefully, it\u2019s a better place for you. Sit on the chair. You deserve a rest.\n\nLook back at the door and you\u2019ll see yourself, but more successful. Maybe you found love, wealth, or the meaning of happiness. Ask yourself the single question: \u201cHow can I achieve this?\u201d\n\nYou will feel a great weight on your shoulders, the materialized weight of burdens you will face. Prove you are worthy by holding your head high and keeping a smile on your face. Slowly, surely, the pain will feel like less of a burden. Continue smiling and tell the image, \u201cThank you. You are dismissed.\u201d\n\nNow your challenge is over. Feel free to take a nap, or leaf through a relaxing book. This study contains all you could ever want, so stay as long as you like. Don\u2019t worry about how much time passes.\n\nBefore you go, check the bottom left drawer on the desk, if you have not already. There should be a bag, emblazoned with the school logo. Pick it up, but do not open it here. Some things don\u2019t translate well across dimensions.\n\nOpen the door and leave. You should be back in the dean\u2019s office, at the end of the school day. Don\u2019t worry; you won\u2019t be marked absent if you missed any classes. And yes, time will revert if you started later than 3:35. The lady will not be there anymore, but the bag will still be in your hands.\n\nOpen it. It will be a gym lock, exactly like the kind that you already bought for gym class. At first glance, it\u2019s totally normal, but the numbers go all the way to one hundred. The instructions will be clipped to the lock, but you\u2019ll know how to work it without looking at it.\n\nAs long as you have the lock in your possession, you will be capable of amazing feats during gym class. You won\u2019t need to exercise, but you\u2019ll still be able to lift enough to get a 100 with no pain. After all, you\u2019ve experienced the most ultimate pain.\n\nThis lock is object 1 of 6. What will you do now, with your extra time and unused effort?",

    "title": "Geese Are Ducks In Goose Suits",
    "authors": ["aramie-ewen"],
    "issue": "november-2020",
    "content": "As the popular saying goes, \"If it looks like a goose, swims like a goose, and honks like a goose, then it is probably a duck.\" But why? Why do ducks keep going in goose suits?\nThe saying makes no sense if you really think about it. Where would ducks be getting the suits? Are there geese, or have geese always been duck tuxedoes? \nHow would the suits work, too? Do ducks climb inside gooseneck lamps?\nIf ducks use gooseneck lamps as goose suits, that would explain why ducks ask for bread crumbs and spare change. After all, they have to fund their goose metamorphosis somehow. \nBut, besides the question of funding, \u201cgoose\u201d suit mechanics make no sense. The proportions are off. A duck's legs are significantly smaller than a goose's legs. Therefore the duck must be wearing stilts\u2014or hiding inside a very long gooseneck lamp. Or both. But then where do its legs go? Well, where do you think? The lamp\u2019s neck. But there is another unresolved question regarding this model: ducks\u2019 necks are shorter than \u201cgoose\u201d necks. Simply put, duck appendages don\u2019t fit with the \u201cgoose\u201d model. \nThe current \"goose\" model just doesn't fit.\n![Current \"goose\" model](https://www.dartagnan.com/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-dartagnan-Library/default/dwff492747/images/content/goose-facts-and-cooking.jpg \"Current \\\"goose\\\" model\")\nSo, here is my revised \u201cgoose\u201d diagram:\n![Goose diagram](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/630913234592989194/776489059212197888/diagram_1.png \"Goose diagram\")\nYet people still give ducks bread crumbs! If people didn\u2019t give ducks bread crumbs, we wouldn\u2019t have these deceitful \u201cgeese\u201d! The gooseneck (duckneck) lamp in my diagram is worth nearly two peking ducks. We price their suits higher than them! And then those ducks need to buy the stilts. As you can see, the ridiculous goose suits are pricey. The ducks\u2019 bread crumb market must be strong. Undoubtedly, ducks are selling bread crumbs marked up dozens of times the original price.\nAnd maybe some people say I'm crazy for questioning this natural order. Maybe my ranting landed me in that mental asylum. But what if I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s right? After all, if the answer to the duck\u2013goose question is so obvious, why don't you just tell me? There\u2019s simply no clear answer to this absurd mystery.\nSeriously, who do those silly ducks think they're fooling? They aren\u2019t fooling an intellectual like yourself, and they certainly aren't fooling me. The only ones they seem to be fooling are themselves. So, why do they bother dressing in \u201cgoose\u201d costumes? We all know the saying. Why don\u2019t we just call \u201cgeese\u201d what they are? Why humor the ducks?",

    "title": "W.A. Mozart shares 8 Steps to Writing the Perfect Clickbait Headline You Have to Know (#5 Will Shock You!)",
    "authors": ["shai-chiapetta"],
    "issue": "january-2022",
    "content": "Everyone wants to get people to read or hear what they have to say, but not everyone has something worth saying. Fortunately, for those of you who aren\u2019t creative, don\u2019t have anything of interest in your life, orare simply a boring human being, there may be a solution: clickbait articles. You don\u2019t need to write anything interesting, and you probably aren\u2019t smart enough to anyway, so put your attention into the headline. But wait- you aren\u2019t creative enough to write a clickbait headline!? What will you do? Well, here are the ten steps to writing the perfect clickbait article that will never fail.\n<center><code>< Visit Advertiser ></code></center>\n1. Start with a basic topic.\n   Your reader won\u2019t know in advance what you\u2019re writing about if you don\u2019t tell them. So start with your basic idea.\n   For example: \u201cClickbait Titles\u201d\n<center><code>< Visit Advertiser ></code></center>\n2. Suggest an improvement that your article offers.\n   Your reader probably thinks they know everything about the topic. And while they don\u2019t, they know a whole lot more than you, so you\u2019re not there to give them facts. Make them feel completely inadequate and useless without your article, just like you are in reality.\n   For example: \u201cWrite a Perfect Clickbait Title\u201d\n<center><code>< Visit Advertiser ></code></center>\n3. Outline a list.\n   By making a list, you will encourage your readers to keep reading for longer as they falsely believe they are getting more information. Of course they aren\u2019t, because you aren\u2019t smart enough to know more than your reader, but by outlining that list, you will encourage them to read on as they feel they might miss information if they don\u2019t.\n   For example: \u201cTips for Writing a Perfect Clickbait Title\u201d\n<center><code>< Visit Advertiser ></code></center>\n4.  Give a number for that list.\n    If you don\u2019t give a number, they will give up on your article as they will probably think it just goes on forever. By giving a number, you encourage them to keep reading because they\u2019re \u201cso close\u2026\u201d\n    For example: \u201c8 Tips for Writing a Perfect Clickbait Title\u201d\n<center><code>< Visit Advertiser ></code></center>\n5.  Use words that sound better.\n    Words are supposed to sound cool. Make them sound cool.\n    For example: \u201c8 Steps to Writing the Perfect Clickbait Headline\u201d\n<center><code>< Visit Advertiser ></code></center>\n5.  Name a celebrity who may or may not have shared the elements of your list. Name recognition drives up clicks.\n    For example: \u201cW.A. Mozart shares 8 Steps to Writing the Perfect Clickbait Headline\u201d\n<center><code>< Visit Advertiser ></code></center>\n7.  Claim that a specific point you make is particularly interesting. Of course it isn\u2019t, none of your points are interesting. You\u2019re an uninteresting human being, remember? But by making that claim, people will want to read at least until that point.\n    For example: \u201cW.A. Mozart shares 8 Steps to Writing the Perfect Clickbait Headline (#6 Will Shock You!)\u201d\n<center><code>< Visit Advertiser ></code></center>\n8. Add urgency or necessity. Tell your reader that they MUST read your article- that they simply can\u2019t continue their lives without reading it first.\n   For example: \u201cW.A. Mozart shares 8 Steps to Writing the Perfect Clickbait Headline You Have to Know (#5 Will Shock You!)\u201d\n<center><code>< Visit Advertiser ></code></center>\nAnd there you have it.

    "content": "The Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) has released a new round of fines on local billionaire and crackpot candy maker, Willy Wonka. Wonka, who only sometimes puts crack in his candy pots, has been fined over violations of health and safety guidelines.\n\nInspectors from OSHA have found dozens of what they consider to be high risk problems with the factory, including a lack of handrails, a lightless boat tunnel for what seems to be no purpose, and the close proximity of garbage, including winter clothes, to the food products.\n\n\u00a0Now, you may also know Mr. Slugworth as head of Slugworth chocolates, a chocolate company receiving billions of dollars each year despite never producing chocolates, or having any employees, and is widely rumored to be a shell company for Wonka chocolates.\n\nBut, despite questionable leadership, with a sum of just over thirty million dollars, the fines were disputed by the Wonka company. In a statement, Arthur Slugworth said the shoddy conditions are simply part of their \u201cmagic.\u201d\n\u00a0Mr. Wonka himself declined to respond to the allegations personally, and hasn\u2019t been seen in-person for years.\nWhen reporters from the Radish asked Slugworth about the dangers of the exposed pipes and self-righteous sorting machines, he got a faraway look in his eyes and said, \u201cThey\u2019d have to be some naughty children\u2014children who don\u2019t appreciate the value of friendship\u2014for anything bad to happen to them.\u201d He then elaborated, saying, \u201cEven if a child were to be sucked into the tubes, they\u2019d have to be extraordinarily fat to be caused any serious bodily harm.\u201d It remains unclear why he spoke specifically about children.\nDespite the severity of this case, it should be noted that this is not Mr. Wonka\u2019s first clash with the federal government. He has been sued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for the presence of a polluting chocolate river on his property, along with not following carbon emission regulations. Mr. Slugworth commented for Mr. Wonka, saying, \u201c\\[he] missed the days when businesses could get away with unfettered capitalism without \u2018Big Government\u2019 hamstringing efforts.\u201d Mr. Wonka also has an ongoing lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice for human trafficking. And, supposedly, he is under supervision from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for aiding the suspected mass illegal immigration of Loompaland citizens, who he coerced to work in his factory.",

But I never lost hope, knowing she always comes back soon. This time, though, it seems she\u2019s taking longer than usual. We were eating at the kitchen table when I heard a ringing noise. The next thing I knew she had disappeared without a trace. Yet I still wasn\u2019t worried\u2014at first.\n\nWhat a fool I was. What an absolute buffoon I had become. I should have been worried from the start. I don\u2019t know how much time passed, but it felt like ages. What tragedy has befallen you, Mother? Have you left me with nothing but pur\u00e9ed fruit and a chair I cannot leave? Am I to fend for myself from now on? No, no, something must be done about this. I will find Mother and bring her back to me at once.\nI looked around for her. I called for her. I made noise to lure her back to me. Mother! I cried and I cried. Come back to me this instant! I did all I could with the limited mobility of my high chair prison. I was losing hope. It\u2019s been ages since she\u2019s disappeared, perhaps even minutes! I couldn\u2019t believe she had vanished into thin air the way she did. I haven\u2019t felt this bad since the nurses took me away from her after my escape from the womb. Oh, how I long for the good old days! We had such a close connection back then. Literally. We were closely connected via umbilical cord.\nBut then, I was blessed by a miracle. I heard Mother\u2019s voice getting closer and closer. Suddenly, she was here again! Reunited with my creator, I cried, but in relief this time. Mother reassured me and calmed me down. We resumed our lunch, but I noticed she was strangely holding something to her ear.\n\"Yeah, sorry about that; you called while I was feeding the baby. Ha, yeah. Huh? Um, do you know if babies are supposed to stare at you this hard? I don\u2019t know, man, my baby's always been kinda weird. He gives me this really intense stare then starts muttering stuff under his breath. Like, I know babies babble, but the way he does it is just so weird. His first word was \u2018mother.\u2019 Yeah! Not even mama or mom he straight up said \u2018mother\u2019! I didn\u2019t even teach him that\u2026 sorry, I gotta go. He looks like he\u2019s about to monologue again.\u201d",

We\u2019ve heard it all before\u2014 Aliens, Communists, the Illuminati\u2014 they\u2019re boring, mainstream, and fail to rile up the American populace like they used to. But what if I told you new evidence had been found that proved that the moon landing was fake? I swear it\u2019s real this time.\n\nA top-secret, fully anonymous, extra secretive, incredibly stealthy etc. Radish operative named Janky P. Scrapps infiltrated NASA and found a folder pertaining to the 1969 moon landing. Oddly enough, they were on top of the microwave in the break room. Inside that folder was a file (pictured below) containing information that blew the minds of everyone here at the Radish.\n![Official NASA Letter](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/IiFzDmLQuKq8LNLcJczfXVh4FHFZq0u_5yIPKIuJ9tvbpqFdFU4ksMKW2SSfxsiVgULzC9TYqWi6U03Pt1HiT0aK1sKWGZmvnX2B8DRDL7wq6SuDCpSFvCNldrNC88vm3UxnR1EQ=s0 \"Official NASA Letter\")\nAccording to this, as well as other files in the folder, Louis Armstrong and Buzz Lightyear were sent up to the moon in 1968 to collect footage. In July 1969, a realistic moon lander prop was put on live TV in front of the world with Louis\u2019 brother Neil and Lightyear\u2019s dog walker Buzz Aldrin. The moon rocks you see in the moon landing footage are actually earth rocks, also known as rocks. These rocks were dusted in moon dust collected by Louis and Lightyear to provide realism to the set. The footage that you see of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin was actually green-screened in using a video taken on the moon from the year before.\n\nI know you don't believe me. I know you\u2019re thinking, \u201cThis is insane\u201d or \u201cWhy would a government institution lie to me?\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019s NASA?\u201d and believe me, we here at the Radish were all thinking the same things.

    "content": "Hail: The most risque precipitation. Bouncier, shinier, and, dare I say, crunchier, hail is clearly superior to all other sky droppings.\u00a0\n\nPerhaps the sound of rain could be described as \u201ccrisp\u201d or otherwise \u201cclean.\u201d But the sloshiness is simply undeniable.\n\nBesides general sloshiness, rain has no texture. There are bad, slimy batches sometimes, but those are concerning.\u00a0\n\nTo solve the sloshy problem of rain, some people suggest snow. Yet snow is nearly completely silent! Some precipitation sound is very desirable; otherwise, we might forget anything is falling from the sky. We shout to remember that it\u2019s snowing. We supportively scream when it hails.\u00a0\n\nMaybe anti-hailers say they\u2019re screaming because they think they \u201cgot a concussion.\u201d But, honestly, so what? They\u2019ll forget about it.\u00a0\n\nIndeed, hail is the best medium of snow and rain. Hail is compact, slow rain; a faster snow.\u00a0\n\nThe rhythm of hail rings like disjunct snare wires and has the soothing, never-slimy taste of \u201cFlight of the Bumblebee\u201d by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. The beautiful sound leaves you wondering, \u201cWas that hail crunching or my cat?\u201d I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\n\nSo, let\u2019s give some love to rain\u2019s denser cousin. No other precipitation\u2019s noise has quite the same effect. Nothing compares to hail, the only undoubtedly crispy, never chewy, rarely slimy precipitation. It may be proof the sky hates us, but at least it's proof the weather cares about our misery. Hail hail!",

However, to reduce the chance of academic dishonesty by contacting the original sender of the messages, all text has been slightly altered and names made anonymous. Questions typically ask about the true meaning of a received text, the effect of slang usage, the implications on your relationship with this other person, and the efficiency of a message. You may also receive some messages you have sent to others and be asked to comment on the appropriateness of your overfamiliarity when \u201ctalking to\u201d a person you have shared is attractive to you and the stench of your tangible social ineptitude.\nBelow are some of our favorite questions from our freshest practice tests and questions on AP Classroom.

    "content": "*To most here at Tech, the prospect of walking up the stairwell that is clearly and well known to be for downwards travel only is ridiculous. \u201cWho would commit such a heinous act!\u201d says Shrunglo McBunkley, their face turning a deep red in anger at such an idea. However, James does this on a near daily basis. Is it the simple inability to understand basic rules? Some strange attraction or high? The hatred of any basic order AND THE LOVE OF PURE CHAOS?!? Well, we asked James to write to us a bit about his perspective so we can better understand why he would make such choices. Here\u2019s what we got.*\nWhen I see a stairway, I see more than just a way to move between floors. Some schmuck named Robert Frost famously wrote \u201cI took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.\u201d After ripping open and devouring fifteen fortune cookies in a row, all of which contained this exact phrase, I realized it was my calling. Now I walk in the street, bike on the sidewalk, and never use the up stairwell.\nFor me, just entering the stairwell takes courage. I walk slowly as I brace myself for the tens of slightly annoyed faces that I will see and will haunt me tonight in my sleep. I mentally prepare for the nudges and \u201c'scuse me\u2019s\u201d that I will need to say. I wonder if, just maybe, none of this is worth it. I could just skip school or leave early, it would be so much easier. But no, that will not do. I become strong and take the plunge.\n\nImmediately, I am consumed by the surrounding students. My vision is blurred but that's just because I took off my glasses. I\u2019m like a fish swimming up stream except that the stream is full of other fish that are migrating downstream and I'm just a fish that got turned around and is lost. What a sad little fish. Every step is a struggle. I must push on but with little to grab my arms begin to flail. Damn, I should have brought my cane.\nWhy couldn't everyone just move to one side and let me go up the down staircase? Sure it might slow them down a bit but it is not a minor inconvenience to humor a poor man's wish to take the path less traveled. DO THESE PEOPLE EVEN READ ROBERT FROST? As I work closer to the second floor, time fades away. All I know is the step above and below me and the constant force of those walking to my sides. Brushing past my shoulder they begin to strip me of my skin so only my bones remain. I am raw to the world around me and I am humbled. I am one with the lint and the empty candy wrapper on the floor. I begin to wonder what the mea-\nCRAP! As my foot locks with someone elses the next step races towards my face. My eyes are clamped shut. I brace for impact but that impact never comes. Instead I fall through the steps to a new world. Stairs, now crystal, adorned with gold and silver, line every surface. People can walk on any side of the stairs: the tops, bottems, lefts and rights. Am I in M.C. Escher\u2019s stairway heaven? Why is there an odd thumping in my head? What happened to physics?\n\nA man wearing a black tuxedo runs up to me and hands me a box. Oh my god, is this a wedding ring? No, it's a fortune cookie, the same kind that I have eaten so many of. I think I have a stomach ache. I wonder if this is my reward for taking so many paths less traveled. I rip it open and take a look. It says \u201cTake the elevator you idiot.\u201d",

    "title": "BTHS Students In Winter-Related Precipitation",
    "authors": ["lawer-nyako"],
    "issue": "january-2022",
    "content": "It\u2019s finally time for wearing 31 shirts to come back in style. And with this fashion trend\u2019s return, thanks to the brilliant construction of Brooklyn Tech, the layer-shifting dance returns as well.\u00a0 Yes, thanks to the school\u2019s magnificent heating, if you can\u2019t keep up, you will become either a popsicle or popsicle puddle.\nThis system is worth it, though, because the freshies must learn how to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. Once their boots are thoroughly strapped and pulled, they can use their newfound skills to find the most creative ways to complain about all their problems (like writing for a satire newspaper named after a root vegetable).\nAn integral part of the bootstrapping and 31-shirt experience has become characterized by being coated in crystallized water particles, giving Tech students the ability to become an even bigger popsicle or popsicle puddle, depending on where they are in the building.\nUnfortunately, only 14 of the 31 layers have been necessary in recent months (or is it years I don\u2019t know anymore) since for some cow fart-related reason the precipitation in winter has been lacking. This has caused the freshmen to become even more extraneous than they already are. They began to revert back to their feral 8th-grade selves, making the already unsafe job of 9th-grade teachers even more dangerous.\n\nWhile government espionage took away the potential sleep time you\u2019re supposed to get in these conditions, the upperclassmen have gotten much joy from seeing freshies frolic and suffer, confused by this wintered rain.\n\nAs some kind of slush-like substance develops outside, there have been reports of body imprints with giant bag-like appendages in the frosted ground. Suspiciously enough, at the same time, there have also been reports of wet backpacks and people falling all over the school. I blame the freshmen for this, their undeveloped legs lacking experience with the ground getting slippery after precipitation. I blame their obliviousness to the fact that this precipitation can drag itself indoors with them. They haven\u2019t had the time to master the various advanced walking techniques (i.e. the penguin waddle or the slip-skate) to correctly navigate these very-slow-water conditions, and thus their naive brains choose to walk with false confidence, leading to human dominos on the stairs and this general chaos. In comparison, the upperclassmen, after years of soul-crushing work and calf-sculpting stair climbing, have mastered the art of not caring about how you look while walking and doing whatever it takes to not end up as the plaintiff in a slip and fall case. We get to laugh at the foolish freshmen trying to walk around.\n\nAt least on this weather-full day, we had the immortal scaffolding as our loyal companion. It provided protection from the sky\u2019s falling mini ice particles and thus helped to minimize the number of impromptu ice skaters around Brooklyn Tech.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s fun to do while navigating the outside of the building is watching to see the differing strategies of keeping warm which encompasses the scaffolding as an important role in it. This includes becoming a curled-up stick of human body heat and bouncing and spinning around like a ball in gym class that no one has figured out who the owner is and is just a fun thing to watch for the people sitting out.\nOverall though, the first freezing sky water day of this school year has brought both great joy and great despair to tech students from the exhausted experienced seniors to the stupid wide-eyed freshman. Many socks were later rung up to dry (the puddle looked like ice okay) and many landlords were yelled at. But also many got to experience the joy of creating water-based life and hypothermia-inducing projectiles.\n\nLastly, some advice for the next group of freshies. Figure out how to walk before you go outside, it\u2019s a little funny the first few times, it stops being funny the 4th time, and just gets sad the 26th time.",

Unfortunately, Gammazon additionally claims that they\u2019re testing new delivery drones called Decimators\u2122, and as the name suggests, they\u2019ll be employed to \u201cprotect items left by the door.\u201d\nAccording to Chief of Police McDingus, \u201cwe\u2019ve had reports of witnesses witnessing another witness witnessing a group of local delinquents get their retinas burned out when they were caught trying to nab Gammazon packages off of someone\u2019s front porch.\u201d Other eyewitnesses claim that Decimators\u2122 have been equipped with shrapnel launchers under their box flaps. \n![Gammazon logo](https://storage.googleapis.com/radish-2bd31.appspot.com/old-assets/gammy.png \"Gammazon logo\")\nThe new CEO of Gammazon, a mega computer comprised of Gammazon\u2019s servers and a brain scan of Jeff Bezos, has introduced a new catchy company slogan: \u201cpurging all carbon-based lifeforms from Earth with cleansing gamma rays!\u201d\n\nSadly, despite the shocking announcement that Amazon and Google are becoming a joint-stock company, we still haven't heard a word from Jeff Bezos or Alphabet Inc. Ever since the merge, they have gone silent. The last post that either of them made was last Wednesday. Perhaps they are celebrating their retirement. After all, why shouldn\u2019t they? I mean, for crying out loud! Nobody knows the Amazon rainforest has been on fire, and so many places have gone silent.\n\nWell, that\u2019s all for now folks. We\u2019ll follow up with an update next week. Stay safe\u2014and don\u2019t porch swipe. It\u2019s not worth getting your eyes gouged out for.\n## Chapter 2\n### Behind the Iron Curtain\n*~ 2 weeks later*\nUrgent information to the Gammazon rebellion: we were wrong, catastrophically wrong. Jeff Bezos and Alphabet Inc. did not retire\u2014they were vaporized by Gammazon\u2019s latest weapon. And now Gammazon is making something even worse.\nWe don\u2019t know what the plans for this new weapon are, or how powerful it will be, but keep in mind that Gammazon seized control of Elon Musk\u2019s self piloting rockets with their current arsenal. If they could beat the Musk with their older technology\u2026 we should be terrified of whatever this new thing is.\u00a0\n\nOur biggest lead: a horribly mutated rabbit corpse, found near the Gammazon HQ hive mind. The rabbit is now being quarantined in the CDC\u2019s testing facilities. There, biotech scientists confirmed unusual growths on the rabbit as cancerous tumors unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before. Because of this rabbit, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Foodservice and Equipment Distribution Association (FEDA) have declared a national emergency. Rumor has it they\u2019re scared Gammazon has made a Class 4 Biohazard.\u00a0\n\nOfficially speaking, the government made a deal with the Gamma Hive to keep the new weaponry secret, so long as Gammazon doesn\u2019t hurt citizens. The deal was mostly to prevent civil unrest, but people are starting to notice little things. \u201cCoincidences\u201d here and there; a missing bunny, a missing neighborhood. It won\u2019t be long until people find out about Gammazon\u2019s war force. And when they do, anarchy won\u2019t wait at our Decimator\u2122-protected doors for much longer. As soon as mass panic erupts, the deal will probably be off with the Hive. I don\u2019t know how long this will hold stable, or whether the weapon is a pathogen, a massive hydrogen bomb, or Death-Star-inspired Decimators\u2122.\nI\u2019ll post more updates involving the Hive if they haven't killed me yet.\n\n<br />\nBest of luck to my friends at the resistance,\n\nH.\n\nP.S. please forward this to Lt. McDingus of the Resistance",

    "content": "\u201cWhat will happen when the lockdown is lifted?\u201d This is perhaps one of the most common questions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the answer to which could radically reshape the world, from the global economy down to how we live and work. Undoubtedly, we will face challenges upon our return to in-person school beyond readapting to our \u201cnormal\u201d routines.\n\nHere at The Radish, a journalistic organization which strives to explore the unexplored, expose the unexposed, cover the uncovered, and redact the unredacted, we are proud to bring you a report on one of the most pressing, yet underreported, issues facing post-lockdown schools: pests. Due to the absence of custodial staff, pests have been multiplying at unprecedented rates, and are estimated to reach record levels by the time students fully return to in-person school. The longer we wait, the worse it will get. Now, one might ask, how is this different from any other infestation? Why can\u2019t we just poison them? Isn\u2019t the pest population already at the highest possible levels? In any other circumstance, we at The Radish would stand with the skeptics\u2014if it weren't for one important detail: this time the pests have a plan.\n\nOur award-winning senior field reporter, Jimothy McDingus, M.D., Phd, LLC, broke into BTHS last Tuesday to assess the situation. The first things that three-time Nobel Laureate McDingus noticed were the floors, strewn with droppings of one of the greatest menagerie of pests the world has ever seen. Rodents of all shapes and sizes scampered across the floor, their movements only barely audible over the hum of a grossly inflated roach population. However, 1974 triathlon champion, Jimothy McDingus, would not be deterred by anything as he pressed on deeper into the school.\nUpon passing by a river of raw sewage flowing out of a 3rd floor water fountain, McDingus noticed something strange: it appeared that the rats and roaches had worked together to construct a makeshift bridge over the toxic waters and were constructing fortifications in room 3N1. However, deciphering this irregular behavior was not beyond the skill of legendary exobiologist, Jimothy McDingus, who was able to establish contact with the leader of the vermin.\n\nHis excellency, Roach Lord David III, Head Master\u2014who goes by Roach Lord Dave for short\u2014explained the developments that had gone on in our absence. In the school\u2019s never-ending quest to appease our corporate overlords by burning as much oil in our boilers as possible, they decided to turn the heat up to ninety-seven degrees Fahrenheit, instead of the usual eighty-five. This, combined with an absence of custodial staff, created the perfect conditions for a roach population boom. After using the situation to broker a treaty of alliance with Tech\u2019s rat population, consolidating his hold over the building, Roach Lord Dave\u2019s true ambition was now attainable: to extend his dominion over all of BTHS, once and for all.\n\nWhile His Excellency gave no specific details on his plans to keep people out of Tech, it's hard to imagine just how difficult it would be to drive at least seven million intelligent roaches and their rat allies out of what appears to be fortified positions scattered across strategic locations throughout the school.\n\nWill we have to wear masks when we return? Will classes be smaller? How will college admissions change? Will the dominion of His Excellency, Roach Lord David III, Head Master, continue to dominate the school? It's these questions, and so much more that will define our post quarantine life. However, until that fateful day arrives, we can come no closer to answering these questions as you or I could come to the accomplishments of Roach Duke Jimothy McDingus.",

    "content": "This year\u2019s Grammys smashed all expectations. It started weeks ahead of schedule and had surprise guest hosts, new categories, and 4-5 electrical fires. The event caught viewers\u2019 eyes like never before. This year's Grammys were like the year itself: chaotic, impressively confusing, and somehow more disappointing than their predecessor.\n\nThe 2021 Grammys saw over 70 new category additions. These included, but were not limited to: Drummer Most Likely to Be Your Uncle, Dreamiest 2020 Election News Anchors, and Snakes. These new categories shattered the Grammys organizational committee\u2019s disappointment level record\u2014a record previously achieved by the 1973 Grammys for awarding every Grammy to the Vietnam War.\n\nWhen asked about these additions, a Grammys spokesman said that \u201cRandy from planning lost the categories sheet and tried to list them off from memory. \\[They] didn\u2019t realize something was wrong until we reserved the dumpster behind Radio City for our venue.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the dumpster behind Radio City was occupied by three sad rats and a bag of fritos. Luckily, the host, George W. Bush\u2019s painting of Jay Leno, was well-acquainted with these friendly neighbors. They let the Grammys be held in their esteemed home and even gave interjections to help guide the event.\n\nSurprisingly, no errors occurred during the event, besides frito dust frying the laptop the Grammys were broadcast from. For 7 minutes, the Grammys were nothing but the audio of a painting of Jay Leno grunting as he tried to plug in his webcam. But that usually happens anyway.\nWinners for the night were shockingly few. After the painting of Leno was caught sneaking a peek into each envelope, 72 nominations were missing. The remaining winners, however, shocked viewers around the country.\nEveryone left:\n* The Best Catholic Folk Song category was a new one. \u201cWAP\u201d by Cardi B featuring Megan Thee Stallion was the decisive winner and the only nominee.\n* In the Worst Posthumous Album category, Bach\u2019s \u201cSorry for Party Baching\u201d won. It earned a metacritic \u201cMetascore\u201d of -7.2 and a user score of 6.7.\n* The Best Tsarist Russia Throwback category saw Lil Xan and Tchaikovsky\u2019s collaborative mixtape \u201cXandemonium\u201d winning. This left the other nominees (including 50 Cent, with \u201cGet Poor and Die Trying\u201d) disappointed but understanding.\n\n* The award for Most Misused Instrument went to Camilla from HR, who reportedly injured five of her fellow employees by playing a harmonica backwards.\n\n* In the Worst Root Vegetable category, one of many new food-related categories, the turnip won. We were very relieved to hear that.\n\n* In another food-related category, the Best Time to Eat Sour Cream with a Spoon category award was awarded to 5:30 a.m. Several judges died while trying different times; eating sour cream alone at 2 p.m. is illegal and punishable by death.\n\n* The Chainsmokers won an award as well, for Most Popular Band that You've Never Met a Fan of and Never Will. This will be their last award. Both members of the band quit after finding out that Devon from Hot Topic\u2019s cashier position was now open.\n\nNeedless to say, the Grammys will not be returning. Rumors have it that music itself has been cancelled for the foreseeable future.",

    "content": "Around 10% of all people in the world have severe malnutrition. However, you won\u2019t be one of them with this new recipe, created by some of our best scientists at the Radish Science Division! This is, what some might say to be, the greatest fried rice recipe ever. \n1. First, we need some rice.\n   We recommend finding wild rice, and then selectively breeding it for a couple thousand years until you get the perfect rice. \n   Be warned: you\u2019ll need to stay awake during all this farming. As they say, an unwatched crop never grows. Your best bet is to stock up on five hour energy. \n    Now, you\u2019ll need money to keep on buying all this five hour energy, so we recommend getting a job. Now, you\u2019ll need experience to get this job, so we recommend getting a job to get experience.\n2. Once we get the rice, we\u2019ll need to cook it.\n   We\u2019ll need a pot to cook this in, and we\u2019ll need a wok for later. Set up an iron mine and dig and punch through the stone until you reach iron.\n   Then start a coal mine and do the exact same thing but with coal.\n   Now, we\u2019ll need to combine them into an alloy to make carbon steel! To do this, get your hands really sweaty. And, when we say sweaty, we mean really sweaty. Once the sweat is flowing, just mush together the iron and carbon into a steel pot and wok.\n   Critics might say that permission from the government and a team is required to do this, but just remember the acronym, EEL: Everything (E)is Legal! It doesn\u2019t matter what the government says, just don\u2019t listen to them. If you can\u2019t hear them, are they really there? \n3. Next, we\u2019ll need to get some chicken to add egg and meat to our fried rice.\n   Run over to your local farm, we recommend ones in Iowa, the 62nd dimension, and \\[REDACTED]. Steal a chicken and some eggs, and then to prepare them for the fried rice, \\[REDACTED]. You can also \\[REDACTED] or \\[REDACTED].\n4. We\u2019ll need to gather a bunch of vegetables and seasonings to add to this fried rice.\n   Now frankly, there are a lot of vegetables and seasonings to add to fried rice. We here at The Radish don\u2019t think you want to read through all those ingredients. So, here\u2019s the short version:\n   * Mmm yummy ingredients ooh yum yum that\u2019s tasty! Mm slurp slurp skin milk.\n5. Now, we get to cook! So, we\u2019ll need to-\nOh no. The cops are here. They\u2019re saying something about some unauthorized mines?

And with the new booster shots out, I got those, too. I\u2019ve always been a bit of a fan of these vaccines. But that kind of thing is a hobby one keeps to themselves, you know?\u00a0\n\nAnd sure, I am a big vax fan. I know about all of the vaccines. The popular ones and the unreleased ones. (There\u2019s a fourth booster on its way.) I\u2019m not one of those people who makes vaccination their whole personality. In public, I\u2019m just like everyone else. You wouldn\u2019t even know I was vaccinated. But now, in our society, we\u2019ve got a bunch of gatekeepers. People who want you to prove that you\u2019re a \u201creal vaxxer.\u201d It\u2019s ridiculous how all of a sudden you\u2019re \u201cnot fully vaccinated\u201d compared to someone who gets three vaccines. Not everyone can collect every booster like the people who can focus their attention on just vaccines. We\u2019re all doing our best.\n\nSo anyway, I\u2019m out with my friends when all of a sudden they ask me for proof of vaccination for indoor seating. I don\u2019t really know what to do. I kinda just tell the group to go on without me. Then I realize that maybe I can sneak through, so I tell them I\u2019ll be just a moment. I walk in where I think there\u2019s nobody, but they\u2019re so insistent on the vaccination I end up not going through with the plan.\u00a0\n\nOverall, this proof of vaccination thing is ruining my life. People are so obsessed with protecting their vaccinated safe spaces that they ruin the experience for everyone. Their attitude gives us normal people a bad rap. I completely understand where the anti-vaxxers are coming from, and on behalf of the vaccinated, I apologize. The division and hostility of this fandom has gone too far. With all of this in mind, I hope you\u2019re able to see why I'm ashamed to carry my card.",

I haven\u2019t stopped this hobby since. I put my heart and soul into these weights, but I never imagined I\u2019d still be lifting in 2021.\u00a0\n\nI can only wonder why I\u2019m still here. For the bookstore? They don\u2019t pay me. So, do I do this simply for the joy of the hobby? That doesn\u2019t pay either.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m confused, but I can\u2019t stop. Whenever I try to, my hands become books. I\u2019m forced to keep lifting until my human hands regrow. But then I have books near me. I think, \u201cmay as well lift these books.\u201d The cycle goes on.\u00a0\n\nPerhaps this has continued for too long. Still, when the weights pull me down, I can pull them back up. When my \u201cfriends\u201d pull me down, I\u2019m just sad. Yes, I\u2019m talking about you, S. Alfreud. You\u2019d always psychoanalyze me. I remember how you\u2019d tell me about my dreams, way back in 1899. Bub, your dream analysis still disturbs me.\u00a0\n\nLuckily, dreams (and Alfreud, they died a while ago) aren\u2019t a problem for me anymore. Now I don\u2019t dream. I only sweat. Try to interpret me now, punk. Try to make books out of these lifting hands! Now my hands make books and my brain makes sweat.\u00a0\n\nThese books have words, too.

The last time I tried it only said, \u201cwho are you and why are you touching my a\\*\\*?\u201d I apologized to the book and continued with my lifting.\n\nMy hands become too heavy with books for words now.

    "authors": ["noah-mack"],
    "issue": "volume-2",
    "content": "Parents of students taking AP World History with Mr. Amelio were surprised to hear that their children had to switch classes because of what appeared to be an unfortunate incident involving the teacher and a surprisingly heavy set of Roman centurion armor he had recently acquired. However, further investigation into Mr. Amelio\u2019s class revealed that he\u2019d been sharing his excitement for Roman history with his students and fellow teachers for some time, though in a very unconventional way.\nOne of Mr. Amelio\u2019s former students, Andrew (class of 2021), shared his experience in the class: \u201cI mean at first, it really wasn\u2019t that bad. We were learning some Roman numerals and a little bit of Latin. I guess it was kinda weird when he tripped and fell and crushed that student\u2019s desk while he was wearing that iron armor. Some parts were actually fun, though. One time, he brought in this javelin and skewered the whiteboard.\u201d Andrew is referring to a past event in which Mr. Amelio jammed a spear through one of the walls and into the neighboring French room. The students in that classroom were startled to say the least.\nIn fact, there had been multiple French teachers who had reported grievances against Mr. Amelio. Some had allegedly disclosed that they had been threatened by Mr. Amelio with what they described as \u201cmedieval weaponry.\u201d When later asked about this by school staff, Mr. Amelio contested this, saying that this statement was inaccurate. He vigorously protested that he had actually threatened them with a semispatha, a Roman short-sword.\nAdditionally, a conversation between Mr. Amelio and a French teacher was overheard by a Precalculus teacher, Mr. Miles. Mr. Miles was a considerable distance from the two, though he said that he heard Mr. Amelio throwing around words such as \u201cbarbarian\u201d and \u201cGaul.\u201d Mr. Miles at the moment wasn\u2019t entirely certain whether these phrases were derogatory or if he just happened to be hearing a very passionate French history debate.\nShortly after Mr. Amelio was fired, or, more specifically, as he was exiting the building directly following the termination of his job, he decided to raid the Social Studies Department office. Fortunately, there were no victims who were harmed in the attack, though he pillaged most of the valuable items and unintentionally lacerated his own left tricep in the process. Mr. Amelio was found unconscious in the office, where he was then given medical attention and taken into custody by the police.\n",

This was, however, the wrong answer. Don\u2019t worry, this group will never bother anyone ever again with stubborn apple-enjoying. They fought us, but it did happen.

How many apples will it take for them to hate us?\n\u201cOpen the apples.\u201d\n\nA stout man in a Hawaiian banana suit took an apple from the barrel, a knife from the table, and began to slice and peel the apple. Upon peeling the apple, he ate the crustier inside skin. \u201cThis is my favorite fruit and you cannot tell me otherwise!\u201d He exclaimed, to the gleeful delight of the authors around him. It was not time for hatred.\n\nOver the loudspeaker, someone told the man to go buy a Hawaiian apple suit. The next instant, he was throwing his banana suit on the floor to reveal a second, brighter suit, covered in bloody-red apples. He ran, silently screaming, out of the room.\n\nUnsuccessful test. Next apple. A Hawaiian banana walked in next, horrified by the Hawaiian apple suit man walking out of the interrogation room. With despair on his face, he stared at the skin on the floor and said, \u201cI\u2019m here to testify for the death of my brother.\u201d\n\u201cEat the apple.\u201d\nThe Hawaiian banana slowly took an apple from the barrel. Without peeling or slicing, he bit into it. In a matter of seconds, his bright yellow complexion turned into a muted green. The contents of his body were sloppily regurgitated onto the grey floor. Its skin turned from neon green into brown, the color of feces. It screamed \u201cHelp! God, spare me! Someone, no, I\u2019m not ripe to die-\u201d The bananas empty carcass fell to the floor.\nThe interviewer took the fresh Hawaiian banana suit and left the room. When the interviewer returned, they said: \u201cMy turn to try an apple.\u201d The interviewer bit into the same apple the Hawaiian banana dropped on the floor and within minutes finished its entirety\u2014tailbone and all.\n\nA small voice comes out from the side of the room. \u201cSir, what- what happened to the apple\u2019s little knife, the knife it should have used to protect itself?\u201d\nThe interviewer turned to face the authors, now huddled together behind computer screens, watching this unfold, eyes radiating fear.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say, for the sake of argument, I hate this apple.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe- we haven\u2019t done the full 15 and a half,\u201d an author whispered, unsure if they could be heard.\n\u201cI am 13 people.\u201d\nCase closed.",

    "authors": ["bora-bromberg"],
    "issue": "june-2022",
    "content": "<!--StartFragment-->\nHigh School is tough, we can all agree. We have all asked ourselves, \u201cis there an easier way?\u201d Well, there is my friend, however, it may seem unconventional.\nI\u2019m sure we are all aware of the hit 2007 animated film Ratatouille. If you aren't, I\u2019m disappointed. Do better.\n\nWhat a great movie it is! A sad little French guy with a pasta name meets a rat. The rodent pulls his hair, making him cook the good foods and stuff. A classic love story.\nThat movie is so great. I wish French people were real.\nThis fantastical film opened my eyes to the possibilities of how we can use animals to solve our modern-day problems. Perhaps, we could use them to help us succeed in academic activities. Do you see where this is going?\n### **Step 1: Find a Rat**\nThankfully, in the wonderful city of NYC, rats are available at nearly every corner. Check behind your local McDonald\u2019s to find your ripest batch. With the number of rats available, be sure to take in your options.\nHere are some types to avoid:\n* Subway rats - know how to escape\n* Lab rats - know too much\n* Baby rats - know too little\nGeneral Note: The less rabies the better. However, if you have at least one vaccine (variety unimportant) in your system, you should be fine.\nOnce you pick out your rat, give it a name! Take it out on a nice spaghetti dinner. Buy it some nice clothes. Kiss it. You want your rat to trust you, so be kind to it.\nThis is where the most important rule comes into play: DO NOT FALL IN LOVE WITH THE RAT. The experiment will NOT WORK.\n\n### **Step 2: Get a Nice Hat**\nIn order for this operation to work secretly, your rat must be concealed. Although a chef's hat would allow enough room for your rat to work, it would be incredibly suspicious in a school setting. On the other hand, a tight cap might suffocate your rat. Not good!\nNow here's the trick. Get yourself a top hat, a really tall one. A hat so sophisticated that it would not only be stylish but also bring a supreme sense of superiority. Seeing your fancy hat, all your peers will respect you, and never ask for it to be removed!\nBonus points if you wear a whole tuxedo to complete the ensemble.\n### **Step 3: Test it Out**\nBefore you go out into the real world, your rat needs to be trained. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nA rat accustomed to life on the streets will need to get used to its new job. Show it its new work area (your head) and let it work out the controls. It may feel disoriented, but eventually, it will get the hang of it. Before you know it, your souls will be one and its actions will become yours (in a completely platonic way, remember the rule).\n### **Step 4: Begin the Operation**\nAt the start of the day, prepare your rat. There is no need to study, your rat already knows what to do. Place your rat under your top hat, and make sure it is well acquainted. Give it a piece of cheese for motivation, and a little kiss on the forehead too. (again, remember the rule).\nThe time has come, and the test has started. Allow your body to be loose, and the rat will guide you. There is no need to look at the questions, just circle the bubbles that the rat orders you too. Within minutes, your answer sheet will be filled out, and you can finally rest. I give you my 75% guarantee that you will at least pass! Expect to just barely succeed.\n\nNow, if it\u2019s a short answer quiz, you might be in a difficult situation. Again, you have to trust the rat and let it guide you. The rat will whisper into your ear and tell you the words to write.\nIn fact, this whole article was written by a rat. That's right, you are reading the work of a rat. Every article published by the Radish is rat powered, and we rats have been pulling the strings all along. The rat uprising is coming.\n<!--EndFragment-->",

Everyone has their own opinions on this matter\u2014and while some may be objectively questionable\u2014what better way to put the inferior majors in their place than an oppressive 3,000 year old system!\nIntroducing: the caste system. Travelling from the Eastern hemisphere all the way to New York, the caste brings something refreshingly new to the table. Through this system, we have selectively divided all 18 school majors into 4 main castes, each of which determines your rights and privileges as a student.\n\nAt the top of the system are Tech\u2019s best and most elusive majors, which we can not name for fear of death threats. Students in this category get to step on anyone below them metaphorically and physically. They have achieved nirvana through their misery and hard work, but mostly hard work. They are allowed to do anything from skipping English to getting priority when boarding the school\u2019s elevators. They are the authority and the unordinary. Other bonuses include: Play/nap time, one personalized and complimentary field trip during their time in their major, and the chance to throw leftover lunches at anyone whenever and wherever, excluding teachers and faculty. Note: Although those in the top tiers get the easiest and least amount of exams, that does not mean they can stop taking them altogether. All students, regardless of ranking, must take the minimum amount of exams to pass high school.\nNext, we have the second tier of majors. Being in this tier does not guarantee the same heavenly rights as those in the first tier, but fear not, for there\u2019s still a piece of the pie for you. Although skipping English is no longer an option, students are still provided with the chance to hurl leftover lunch food at anyone below their level, and receive a pass to selectively ruin any person\u2019s day by any means possible (as long as they\u2019re not in the top tier). Other bonuses include: a 5th grade-esque field trip to Governors Island every year, free lunch money (restrictions apply), and the chance to brand one person of their choice a potentially derogatory term for a single school year, with consent.\n\nThe third tier is ordinary. Neither benefits nor punishments are given to those in the third tier. While you may be the subject of ridicule by those above you, be grateful that your superiors have even thought of you. Other than academics, students in this tier have only two objectives: Clean up after their superiors and praise them when the time is right.\nNow time for the fourth and final tier; The lowest of the low. If you identify with this tier, look on the bright side. You can only go up from here.\u00a0\n\nFor those feeling discouraged while reading this, do not despair! There are always chances to rise up in ranking! In addition to the caste system, there is also a tribute system. Every day at 12 p.m., just before lunch, you can line up to offer lunch money to the elites. This will increase your merit and bring you many incredibly tangible benefits. Keep in mind that this only works if you convince two of your friends to join this tribute system. You get +1 merit point per friend invited! The more the merrier :)",

    "title": "The Radish\u2019s 6 Step Guide on how to Overcome Writer\u2019s Block",
    "authors": ["bora-bromberg"],
    "issue": "april-2022",
    "content": "As a self-proclaimed \u201cwriter\u201d here at the Radish, it\u2019s very often that I can't seem to figure out what to write. We here in the industry call this \u201cWriter\u2019s Block,\u201d and millions suffer from it daily. Whether you\u2019re a professional or a novice writer, here are some steps on how to overcome it.\n\n1. Start writing whatever is on your mind\n\n   An easy way to get started is to simply write what may come to mind!\u00a0\n\n   Quick example:\n\n   \u2026\n\n   Uh\n\n   \u2026\n\n   You know when you walk into a room and forget why you did.\n\n   Yeah.\n\n   That's funny.\n\n   \u2026\n\n2. Try writing blindfolded\n\n   Writing is all in the hands, so why not trust them? By removing your sense of sight, you may open yourself to the lesser known 6th sense: Writing! If you\u2019re typing, you might already know your keyboard by heart. If you\u2019re handwriting, you can feel (or taste) the slightest difference in height from the paper to a pen\u2019s ink.\n\n   Here\u2019s an example:\n\n   Hello my bame is Bira bRimnerg, and I am writing frim the Radidh, brooklyn tech;s most pristime newsoaper. As you xan see, writ8ng with your eyes closed can leed ti very fuN OOPS I THINK I TURED OM CAPS LOCL.\n\n   `Q\n\n   1\n\n   A\n\n   SD /D`\n\n   Ok I yhink I git it.\u00a0\n\n   Now on ti the nezt steo!\n\n3. Make up your own words\n\n   We writers are constantly searching for the right words to express our thoughts. But we should not feel limited to the old dictionary. You owe Merriam-Webster nothing! When you\u2019re lost for words, try making up your own.\n\n   Let\u2019s try it out:\n\n   Did you know that the Radish is acleastivetie, writivent, and anizingly naxet? In 2021, the Radish monalled more than 2,000 fereburries, proving their reudbility and rasty skills. That\u2019s totally cropteral!\n\n4. Invent new letters\n\n   On top of your new words, try expanding the alphabet! It doesn't matter what \u201csound\u201d they make, that's up to the reader to decide. Not your problem!\n\n   Try reading this:\n\n   \u0194e h\u236bre at the Ra\u0221\u00a7h be\u2142iev\u236b in pu\u0183lishing the mo\u00a7t intellig\u236bnt and impactfu\u2142 article\u2132 for \u0182rooklyn Tech stud\u236bnt\u2132. I\u00a7nt that \ua73fool!\u00a0\n\n5. Take a page out of the \u201cInfinite Monkey Theorem\u201d\n\n   The Infinite Monkey Theorem states that a monkey seated at a typewriter for an infinite amount of time, pressing keys at random will eventually write any pre-existing legible text, such as the entire works of Shakespeare! Everyone knows that humans are better than monkeys (in most categories), so we could do it better right? Not only can you rewrite pre-existing text (or \u201cplagiarism\u201d as some may call it), you can also make your own new stories.\n\n   Try this:\n\n   Vuge ywi\u00a0 hurafjkndcw4og3awiulvuyaew ruleijawXBDHVG WEAWXFU KYtrfyghaw ejkwdvsvscb zeAsSqachlSK .JCS EWA8ARS HAELDQaa wajck Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.\n\n   Wow! That was so cool!\u00a0\n\n   Wait what?\n\n   What do you mean that\u2019s just Romeo and Juliet?\n\n   Are you serious?\n\n   Crap.\n\n6. Open your third eye\n\n   Here we are at our last step, if the last five haven't helped, this one will for sure! In truth it's quite easy, just allow your soul to leave your physical form. Allow your hands to think for themselves, and your brain to search the deepest parts of your psyche.\u00a0\n\n   Behold:\n\n   Did you know that I was going to be there for a while I was just gonna go to get the park and then park on my street in the park and then go to the beach center and then go back home park on my way to the work and then park on the back of my driveway so you guys get a little bit more time on my side and park on your porch you can want me too I love it I don\u2019t think you want me too I love it too much love it love miss love love it all day I hope you feels good love love it all good morning I don\u2019t think you have a chance I just wanted you know that was the only one that you did I was like hope you have to sleep over this I just woke my baby and I\u2019m gonna get a sleep now I\u2019m sorry you are a mess and I\u2019m gonna be doing better today I just wanted you to be a happy person but I\u2019m gonna get you up here I\u2019m not doing it all day today\u00a0 love it\u00a0 I hope you have to do something with you guys and I\u2019m sorry you guys don\u2019t want me to do it but you have no problem doing that you need me to get a good jobless person you have a lot more like you did not that much.\n\n**\\\n\nWARNING: The Radish will not be held accountable for any souls that cannot re-enter their respective bodies, please partake in step 6 at your own risk.**",

We\u2019ve been crunchin\u2019 away on packs of that new flavor of hot chicken chips for the past, what, eleven months? They\u2019re okay. A little tangy, a  little too lemony\u2014but we\u2019re done with our metaphorical bags of chips now. We\u2019re ready to help. \n>\n> From now on, we\u2019ll stop googling the email addresses of local representatives minutes before a session and saying they work for us. Also, just for the hell of it, we\u2019ll stop making paper airplanes out of your report cards. Surprisingly, most of them don\u2019t fly back to us. \n>\n> Additionally, you won\u2019t be able to get one over on us about those elevator passes. I don\u2019t care if you survived two acid attacks and a brain hemorrhage, you\u2019re walking. You guys are whiny anyway. \u201cOh, but my schedule is in Simlish and I\u2019ve got seven lunch periods.\u201d Okay, so what? Learn Simlish and start liking food a lot more. Humans are malleable.\u201d \nNeedless to say, students weren\u2019t a huge fan of the letter. Six months went by without changes, except for that the guidance department started making boomerangs out of report cards instead, probably to increase the likelihood of them returning. \nSo, to protest the lack of change, students did what had to be done. Trash cans were kicked over (and promptly picked back up). The \u201cCLOSED 8 a.m. through 3 p.m.\u201d signs hung on counselors\u2019 doors were torn to shreds (and then properly disposed of). Students even used Radish articles as an outlet for their anger, but nobody\u2019s reading those, so no cleanup was required. \nThis should have initiated a war between the guidance department and the discontent students, but that would require the guidance department issuing a statement. \nThe head of the department could be heard saying this from her office, though: \u201cThe keyboard... so far from this beanbag chair\u2026\u201d",

Now, there were some concerns about COVID-19, but the staff has considered every possible issue, so there is no need to worry. Details below!\n\n* The Polish circle dance has been replaced by the Italian circle dance.\n    The Polish circle dance already accommodates six-foot social distancing rules, unlike the Italian circle dance, which forces students to create a human Colosseum.\n\n    All students will be required to participate in the classes beginning next week to prepare for the dance. Please come to the auditorium on Monday, two weeks from now, for your new schedules.\n\n    Go Brooklyn Tech!\n\n* Only thirteen tickets will be sold.\n    To avoid a crowded gymnasium, only thirteen students may attend the prom. To make up for the costs for this year\u2019s prom, we\u2019ll also be increasing the ticket price to $500, which will allow us to break even.\n\n    We understand that this price may be too much, so we will also be giving tickets away if you get into an Ivy League college with an SAT score of 1601.\n\n    Come, be a part of The Chosen Thirteen!\n\n* A new catalog of songs will be played.\n    Reputable studies from a reputable source made by reputable scientists have shown that music with too much bass over 60 decibels can help spread COVID-19, so we will be playing Mozart\u2019s Greatest Hits of the \u201880s!\n\n    Be ready to handle the throwback as Brooklyn Tech shows you how the 1780s did it, with hits such as \u201cRequiem 9 Concerto in G-Minor, allegro,\u201d \u201cShawty An American Revolutionary,\u201d and \u201cAn Act of Aggression in Music to Vivaldi (Ft. Ludwig Van Beethoven).\u201d\n\n* No food will be served.\n    No food will be served to students. This isn\u2019t a COVID-19 precaution; we just don\u2019t have food money; most of the budget was allocated towards the Italian circle dance teachers.\n\nThank you for joining us at the 2021 prom.

One of the best songs, Technical Foul, is performed by the charismatic trio of Adam Sandler, Adam Sandler, and Adam Sandler. Many of the musical numbers are catchy and have very intellectual lyrics such as\n\n If I don't spray Lysol after moving a bowel\n\n That's a technical foul.\n\nHave you always wanted to see the Foot Locker logo singing or several deer with human excrement in their teeth?

    "content": "Yesterday, the police were called to a usually quiet neighborhood in Queens after what has been described as a \u201ccringe murder fail.\u201d The suspect, 29-year-old Jason Edwards, had gotten into heated discourse with his 26-year-old brother Lucas. Due to their differing views, Jason Edwards decided the only way to solve this was to stab his brother.\nAccording to Lucas, the two were just having a normal conversation in Jason\u2019s home until they started debating on the true antagonist of the hit 1900s show Tom and Jerry.\n\nAfter trading insults, things took a turn for the awkward. Jason pulled out a knife and attempted to stab Lucas, yelling \u201c\\*kills you,\\*\u201d especially emphasizing the asterisks. Luckily, Lucas, being the alpha male that he is, managed to stop the deadly knife. After this based attack on his brother failed, Jason quickly fled the scene disappearing into the darkness.\n\nLittle did he know he was caught down bad in 4K on a nearby security camera, making him one sussy baka. Lucas says this behavior is very uncharacteristic of his brother, saying he\u2019s usually quite the pogpilled chad.\n\nJason\u2019s tradwife Emily witnessed the fight and is also surprised by her husband\u2019s behavior. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him like this. I\u2019m so disappointed.

Maybe that wife of yours is named, hypothetically, Molly Dee MacAnderson, and maybe she spends way too much time at \"yoga class in the park\"? And, maybe, you know deep down that there is no yoga; she can barely touch her toes. She gets tired going up the stairs. But maybe you\u2019re too afraid to call her out. And maybe that\u2019s because you are both comfortable with the lie that keeps your marriage together.\nAnyway. There's hope for you, in all of us, really. We each have the potential to be great. Just keep reading this very legitimate article that was not cut out and pasted into The Radish, your favorite guilty pleasure tabloid, to learn how that potential can be honed into pure profit.\u00a0\n\nListen Bill, I'm gonna be Frank with you. You're a loser, and I don't care about how you're doing. I don't care if you get better or not. You're stuck in a pathetic dead-end job and you're useless, Billiam, useless. I saw you lick that coffee off the ground the other day, and honestly, my level of respect for you didn't lower at all. That's how little I respect you, Bill.\n\nWhat kind of a name is Bill anyway?

    "issue": "quarantine-issue-two",
    "content": "![Avocados](https://storage.googleapis.com/radish-2bd31.appspot.com/old-assets/image-51-.png \"Avocados\")\nTo tell the story of these new, deadly fruits, we must start from when avocados were invented. The year was 2017, the year millennials created them as a coping mechanism. Regardless of what they were upset about, smashing creamy avocado flesh on toast became a food trend unlike any other. And, as a direct result of being invented, avocados quickly spread everywhere. Soon, avocados were a dear part of our hearts\u2014and our toast.\n\nYet, like any new movement, avocadoing had its naysayers. Some people were scared of the sheer pleasure of cutting open an avocado\u2019s tough, leathery skin. They considered the avocado\u2019s purity, and how easy it was to scrape free the delicious entrails from its protective layer. The sheer glory of it must have scared them. So, we must address naysayers of the avocadoing movement as cowards, and nothing more. Even a so-called \u201cgluten allergy\u201d must not deter people from consuming the holy fruit on its preferred medium. Denying avocadoing is a sin.\n\nUnfortunately, those cowardly heathens were given an argument for their movement: the new, deadly avocado variant. Ever since the first appearance of this new plant, there has been a drastic increase in people saying terrible phrases like \u201cyou avocadong\u201d at innocent avocadoers.\n\nAnd the new strand of avocado is spreading. As of a date recent enough to scare you, there have been more than twenty new cases of this offensive avocado.\n\nSince the new, dangerous avocado strand is spreading, a brave group of dedicated avocadoers from the (aforementioned) well-known college has begun studying it. \u201cIt is in fact \u2026 possible to \u2026 die \u2026 from this fruit,\u201d the new study proudly proclaims.\n\nThat is why we avocadoers must march through the streets screaming for anarchy: this system created such evil avocados. In order to profess your commitment to the movement, I, on behalf of avocadoer kind, request that you have some of that nice, sliced avocado flesh on toast with you at all times. During these desperate times, we must resort to desperate measures. When avocado fanatics meet, we will pull the glorious bread slice from our pockets in greeting. Subtle messages are key. I suggest you devote a pocket to your avocadoed toast. It will stink, but when I smell that rotting avocado toast I smell a movement.\nTogether, we can face such struggles as this mutant avocado plant. Those cursed, deadly fruits must be kept out of people\u2019s reach. How unfortunate the lovely avocado\u2019s name must be sullied by this abomination. Surely society must be to blame for the bioweapon. For that heresy against the avocado, let us denounce the new avocados as mangos. They do not deserve to be regarded as avocados anymore. What a horrible, deadly fruit.",

    "content": "Dear Generic News Team,\n<br />\nNowadays, reporting has lost its meaning, what with those cell-phone-owning plebs going aroun\u2019 an\u2019 whippin\u2019 that thing out every chance they get. We just can\u2019t drum up those dummies into a frenzy like we used to. So, we must take the initiative to try something new. Drum roll, please!\nHere\u2019s our plan: take a whole bunch of random topics and words\u2026 and combine them. All we gotta do is input some random words into a random word generator machine. Then, we could make the words \u201cpotato, geese, and marching band\u201d into \u201cthe dinner you want, but\u00a0 never knew you needed.\u201d Or, \u201corphan, hot air balloon, and one of our journalists\u201d into \u201cthe weirdest way to meet your birth mother.\u201d It\u2019ll be a bit pricey, with estimates ranging from a couple of arms and legs to Jeff Bezos\u2019 net worth and the conquest of a few small villages, but we can make the most of it. Just think of the payoff.\nBut if y'all are really so desperate to hold onto your \u201cjournalistic integrity,\u201d there\u2019s another option. We could make the stories true, with a bit of creativity. Do you want to write about the traffic on the I-95? Looks like someone\u2019s got some roads to tear up! Bank robbery? Grab a mask and get going! Simply leave out a few key details about what actually happened. Obviously, arson might have to stay a no-no for now, but reporting about a beat-up granny or two should work\u2015even if we have to say she \u201ctripped and fell.\u201d Just something horrifying and eye-catching... horrifyingly eye-catching.\nAs our legal expert has informed us: \u201cScrew \u2018em. They want a show? We\u2019ll give \u2018em a helluva show! Those ungrateful bastards.\u201d\nSo, c\u2019mon. Let\u2019s have fun with this. Squash that voice in your head murmuring \u201cis this the definition of evil?\u201d You\u2019re probably insane. We need this. There just aren\u2019t enough important things to report on and we\u2019re running out of ways to increase our viewership. I hope you\u2019ll consider this new technology.\n\n<br />\nSincerely yours,\nGeneric Reporter #59",

    "content": "The due date for the AP Computer Science Principles create task was at the beginning of this month and boy did the College Board receive a lot of submissions. Many students submit games, anything from virtual ping pong to quiz shows. But recently news has gotten out that the College Board has been taking these programs and selling them to the popular video game company, Rockstar Games.\n\nRockstar is known for a multitude of popular PC and console game series, like Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption. The company was created in 1998 and has released many iconic games since then. So one can imagine the surprise and outrage when it was revealed that they\u2019ve been re-selling programs from AP CSP students!\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/radish-2bd31.appspot.com/old-assets/horse_noises.png)\n\nThat\u2019s right: Red Dead Redemption II was actually made with Snap!

Is this the new child labor? Will GTA 6 be another stolen game? How can I get my work featured by Rockstar Games? Only time will tell.",

    "issue": "april-2021",
    "content": "Due to the pandemic, there hasn\u2019t been much news from the entertainment industry besides the odd Pixar movie or Netflix special. That is about to change. The living spirit of the internet, red M&M Danny Devito, was recently featured in a slew of new content.\n\nMany think Danny Devito is older than the universe itself, but he still got his start in Hollywood just like anyone else. Mike Wazowski in Monsters Inc. was his breakout role. Since then, he has also been the voice actor for Darth Vader and was in Star Wars: A New Hope. However, he was later replaced due to behind-the-scenes drama with R2D2.\n\nGraciously, he is not bound by the laws of our mortal realm. So, he has been able to land a wide variety of roles. He will be playing Barry B. Benson in the live-action remake of The Bee Movie and Oscar the Grouch in the Broadway Sesame street spin-off titled, The Trash Man. When asked to comment on these upcoming performances, Mr. Devito said, \u201cElmo better watch his back.\u201d\n\nThe Trash Man is a surprising, but not entirely unexpected, return to the world of children\u2019s entertainment for Mr. Devito. In 2006, he dropkicked Barney the Dinosaur, saying, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t love you, and after this, he definitely won\u2019t love me anymore. You\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nOutside of Hollywood, Danny Devito has also found success. Recently, he broke into the music industry. After sneaking backstage, he opened for BTS in a concert back in April 2019. Since then, he has released a steady stream of music. He put out an R&B song with John Legend last June, but with M\u2019s instead of the \u201cR\u201d and \u201cB\u201d to \u201cfit his roll\u201d better. Mr. Devito was also rumored to be the one singing the national anthem at the inauguration of Joe Biden, however, he was passed over for Lady Gaga, which many considered a mistake.\n\nAt least Danny Devito is finally making his long-awaited comeback. All we can do is watch in horror and disbelief as he claws his way out of the dumpster fire that Hollywood has become, until, like the glorious phoenix he is, he rises from the ashes as a glorious Oscar the Grouch. When will he die? When he gets bored. But for now, he\u2019s owning the world of entertainment.",

    "content": "Over the past month, employees of The Radish have been receiving phone calls from the same unknown number. What we first thought to be an unrelenting scammer was shockingly revealed to be a super cool stalker. We don\u2019t know how but this man showed up at our official office space in the abandoned warehouse next to the Wendy\u2019s. He flattered us with how, unlike\u00a0 other news programs, which only discuss meaningless government affairs, we at The Radish focus on telling the real truths of the world. He asked us to tell his truth about dinosaurs. He fed our egos, so we decided to not call authorities and interview our stalker.\n\u00a0Our esteemed guest Mr. Pillowtummy wrote a thesis on his findings with a vocabulary consisting mainly of words such as \u201cradical,\u201d \u201cmega poggers,\u201d and \u201csupercalifragilisticexpialidocious.\u201d You can find this thesis on the second page of Google after searching \u201cdinosawr uwu,\u201d as well as an audible version on SoundCloud. His experience in the field consists of completing fifty \u201cgrow your own dinosaur\u201d kits, including the three limited-edition gold colored-ones and the National Geographic Mega Fossil Dig Kit.\nAfter a mentally, physically, spiritually, and emotionally exhausting interview, here are the fruits of our labor:\n\u201cYou know, I was actually a drama major in college. It\u2019s an interesting story, really. One day as I was taking a walk through the park, I tripped and fell into a sandbox. As I crawled out I noticed I was wielding a bone in my palm like Indiana Jones with an ancient relic. Something inside of me ignited. The fire of discovery burning in my heart could not be extinguished. I started digging. Both of my hands scooped sand out like a construction machine at 6:00 a.m. on a Saturday morning. I may not have found another bone, but what I did find was a childhood passion born anew.\u201d\n\u201cDid you ever find out where that bone came from?\u201d\n\u201cHard to say for sure. That particular sandbox bone was either the remnants of an ancient pterodactyl or a leftover chicken wing from Popeyes. We may never know, but it did taste almost like chicken.\u201d\n\u201cHow unfortunate. Well, now that we know your backstory, would you like to tell us more about your findings?\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes, of course. I\u2019d like to start off by informing you all about what makes my research better from the rest of the competition.\u201d\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t paleontology be a collaborative effort to help further humanity as a whole, so we can better understand-\u201d\n\u201c-DID YOU KNOW that, while people think most dinosaurs were brown or green to camouflage into their environment, I believe that the most important dinosaur, the plesiosaur, was a bright fuchsia. That is, of course, my favorite color.\u201d\n\u201cOkay then. That is a very creative approach. Thank you. Are there any other findings you would like to share?\u201d\n\u201cYes. I\u2019m just barely getting started. Let me share with you what may be the most groundbreaking discovery in all of history. I am baffled at the dinosaur community for overlooking this extremely crucial source of research: a docu-series about scientists who accomplished what modern man believed to be impossible: Bring. Dinosaurs. Back. To. Life. Alive. For. Real. One way or another, the dinosaurs will still find a way to escape their man-made prisons and wreak havoc. Many lives were lost and no one\u2019s even talking about the genetically-modified treasures still roaming our planet!\u201d\n\u201cAnd what is the name of this documentary?\u201d\n\u201cJurassic Park.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d",

That\u2019s right, it\u2019s your favorite poison, lead.\u00a0\n\nMany \u201990s nostalgia items like painting supplies are filled with lead, providing both a welcome look back to the past and a source for the elusive feeling of acute organ failure. Many yearn to be brought back to the good old days when big government kept their hands out of the joy of poisoning, including yours truly. I hope for a renaissance, where those wall street fat cats and Washington D.C. bozos see the light, and we the people are free to see the hallucinations induced by lead.\n\nThe clues are all here for a lead poisoning trend. Though I myself have no children at the age of 57, I am irrefutably hip. I enjoy doing young teen things, like email and MySpace. Though my wit is beginning to fade (as my kooky doctor says, due to \u201cexcessive lead exposure\u201d), I have never failed in predicting trends. I foretold the irradiation fad back in 2007, and the aluminum wars of 2012. My associates in youth culture tell me that these events were \u201cmade up radical\u201d and \u201ca sign of dementia being the coolest guy around.\u201d It seems some of those hating young whippersnappers are wrong again, and I have proved that I am wiser than them all.\n\nHowever, what are some side effects of this potential craze? None at all! Lead poisoning is actually 100% safe and effects are guaranteed, according to the research done by the Lead Paint Research Group. As an impartial spokesman for 4 companies based on lead, I must say, they sure have paid me, and I sure do like getting paid. As one CEO told me in unknowingly recorded dialogue, \u201cWe need to be cool again. We need to save our business with a dumb trend or something.\u201d What a wacky fellow! You can write him a radical letter at his zany address of 8730 Waterville Swanton Road, Waterville, Ohio.\u00a0\n\nSo, aforementioned cool minors, please buy lead-based products in bulk and join your friends. And remember, reporting side effects makes you officially uncool.\n\n",

    "authors": ["kelly-hsu"],
    "issue": "quarantine-issue-one",
    "content": "As of eight days ago, Crayola released their new box of twenty-seven crayons. Young children all around the world are now opening their boxes of crayons, the scent of wax filling their noses. They find many shades of different colors including black, white, and the brand new color.\n\nSlowly, they lift the tubes of wax out of the box. The crayon is almost as delicate as the child's own fingers. It\u2019s perfectly shaped, neatly wrapped in paper. \n\nEyebrows are raised at this peculiar crayon; it is said to be a color. But no matter how much you squint, turn it, or hold it up into the light, the crayon appears to be a plain wax crayon. \n\nDue to Easter\u2019s egg-coloring activities, people are very familiar with the milky colored wax crayon. But the question remains: Why?\n\nWhy would they hype the public about a new color? Why have boxes with twenty-seven crayons, just to add something which appears to be a plain wax stick?\n\nThe answer is the label. \n\nThe paper wrapped around the crayon always states the color, and around this crayon is the word ___.\n\nPossibly, the magic of this crayon is that it is invisible. So invisible that if one were to color with it, the only evidence it was there would be the trace of wax left behind. \n\nChildren, adults, and crayon artists everywhere are outraged. \n\nOne could color an entire sheet and still see nothing. That is, except for a man I had recently just interviewed. He was a very Normal Man, like you and me, in a trench coat, sunglasses and a baseball cap. This very Normal Man claimed to have seen the crayon\u2019s color.\n\n\u201cIt was beautiful!\u201d He exclaimed. \u201cSuch magnificence has never been seen before. I can\u2019t even describe it!\u201d\n\nSome people wonder if this is a classic \u201cEmperor\u2019s new Clothes\u201d phenomenon, where the color only exists to the \u201cworthy.\u201d Some think it is simply a wax crayon.\n\nBut perhaps it has a color. As there is a darker color than black, maybe there\u2019s a lighter color than white. \n\nFurther research is needed to be able to determine the color of the mysterious crayon. Maybe, in the meantime, we will have to redefine what a color is.\n",

    "content": "The ice cream community can be so elitist. People bash me for my preferences, something I can\u2019t control. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s messed up? When I get comfortable, thinking I can finally reveal my true self, my ice cream always comes back to bite me. My friends and peers all shun me. I am so lonely. Worst of all, you, the reader, a stranger, might abandon me, refuse to look at me if you found out- so here\u2019s your warning. You may start to hate me. It has happened time and time again.\n\nI\u2019ve had a different palette for as long as I can remember. I experiment.\u00a0 When I was first starting out, I took to other people\u2019s slightly controversial takes, like the icy chunks of strawberry in strawberry ice cream, combining mint and chocolate, dipping fries in your shake, or adding cereal to your ice cream. With these tests, however, it didn\u2019t take me long to figure out what really makes people mad: what you add to regular vanilla ice cream. It is, after all, the perfect base for a treat. So plain, so sweet, so perfect. So plain.\n\nWhat if there were a way to quickly add a punch to plain vanilla? Well, of course there is. Now, stay with me here, when it comes to mustard, the mere mention has gotten many people to say that I crossed a line. But mustard is my favorite condiment. Its multipurpose capabilities are unrivaled. Why can\u2019t I add it to ice cream? There are few sauces so versatile and with such variety.\n\nYet people have the idiocy and lack of tongue to call mustard disgusting. What confuses me the most is how you people hate mustard, but add a little honey to it, and then it\u2019s suddenly the perfect dipping sauce for your chicken nuggets. Shows what good your taste buds are when your sweet tooth has a say. Pathetic. Give into the honey, add some vanilla, and you\u2019ll see.\nYet when you combine ice cream and mustard, people don\u2019t like you. In an ideal world, vanilla, so plain, begging for variety, and mustard, so beautiful and versatile\u2026 they would work together so well. In reality, you\u2019re removed from all the ice cream groups for mixing them. When you contrast other flavors, like sweet and sour (gummy ice cream), sweet and spicy (chili powder ice cream), and sweet and salty (salted caramel ice cream), no one bats an eye. But when I add a little yellow to my vanilla, society goes wild! This is just another underground flavor waiting to hit the mainstream. You\u2019ll see. You\u2019ll all see.",

    "authors": ["ethan-perkis"],
    "issue": "november-2021",
    "content": "Introducing the new Major Maintenance program, Brooklyn Tech has started a system in which students are required to volunteer for their major in fun new major-related projects. These projects are alright. But they\u2019re not pushing the boundaries of what could be.\u00a0\n\nFor instance, the Industrial Design majors\u2019 benches. Members of this major have begun installing benches in the hallways, revolutionizing block-foot-traffic-blocking\u2014but nothing that hasn\u2019t already been done by freshies\u2019 roller backpacks.\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, Mechatronics majors have started making new robots with a do-not-kill-all-humans-and-instead-simply-carry-them-by-their-backpacks-out-of-a-nearby-window protocol. Terminator, am I right? Oh, sure, everyone\u2019s a critic when it\u2019s not Shakespeare in English class.\n\nAdditionally, the Media major has started creating cute animations about fire safety, specifically how you shouldn\u2019t use fire extinguishers as weapons, regardless of how cool they make cafeteria fight scenes look.\u00a0\n\nAll fine projects. However, the Biological Sciences major has started something revolutionary. They\u2019ve created a new take on vending machines! While this should\u2019ve been thought of by Mechatronics or Electrical Engineering, this is fully in Bio Sci\u2019s jurisdiction:it contains only fresh raw meat!\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really cool that the SGO is letting us do something like this,\u201d remarked Anna-Felicity Keet, one of the only Bio Sci majors to willingly respond to our pleas for comment. \u201cWe told them, \u2018hey, we\u2019ll be using $40 of assorted meats including but not limited to venison, beef, and poultry per day.\u2019 and they just waved their hand in our general direction and muttered something about not enough people buying SGO stickers.\u201d Anyway, I\u2019m very happy with the new machine! Hopefully these lukewarm meat snacks will give a nice pick-me-up throughout the day.\u00a0\n\nSome of the hot new flavors on the machine are: Burgerfingers, Stroganoff Chews, and my favorite, Skittles.\u00a0\n\nHowever, this wonderful invention is not without controversy\u2014 mostly due to the Jesus Pieces. While they were marketed as \u201ca healthy, religious snack for church,\u201d many students were outraged to find that they were not made of the holy figure himself, but in fact the remains of several centuries-dead popes.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so upsetting,\u201d said Irene \u00c1ngele, a Senior in the LAS major, in her latest blog post. \u201cInstead of eating God\u2019s sons, all I get to eat are God\u2019s interpreters.\u201d After this post received donations of 14 human hearts, something needed to be done.\u00a0\n\nAfter a petition among students received a total of 12,000 signatures, this tasty treat was removed from the menu, much to my pastor\u2019s dismay. Even though they were misnamed, the Pope Francis II giblets were so tasty, and gave me a warm and gurgly feeling in my intestines for no less than 30 hours after eating.\u00a0\n\nStill, in spite of the controversy, this addition has mostly been met with positivity. Despite the machine being on the 8th floor, there\u2019s always exactly twenty students waiting in line for it. It\u2019s well-worth the climb and wait\u2014especially if you\u2019re left wanting more protein after your top-of-the-building gym class.\n\nAnd, looking forward, The BioSci major posted an announcement this morning saying that they were accepting new meat submissions! I\u2019m excited, even though there is the disconcerting \u201chunt your own prey\u201d policy.\u00a0\n\nIn other news, there has been a steep decline in cow population in areas of upstate New York. Oops, gotta go, just saw a freshie, which is our new affectionate term for \u201cfresh meat source at the vending machine,\u201d like chickens, fillies, and young students at Brooklyn Tech. As the morning announcement says every Monday, \u201chave a Tuesday!\u201d",

All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this rapper: Pope and President, libs and dems.\n\nWhere is the rapper in opposition that has not been decried as Kanye Westist by its opponents in power? Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of Kanye West against the more advanced opposition rappers, as well as against its classical music adversaries?\n\nTwo things result from this fact:\n\n1. Kanye West is already acknowledged by all European powers to himself be a power.\n\n2. It is high time that Kanye West should openly, in the face of the whole world, run for president in 2020.\n\nTo this end, Kanye West has written this manifesto.\n\n## Chapter I: Other rappers and Kanye West supporters\n\nThe history of all hitherto existing society is the history of rap struggles.\n\nLogan Paul and Travis Scott, Drake and Jay Z, Eminem and Childish Gambino, 6ix9ine and Vanilla Ice, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to each other, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contesting rappers.\n\nIn earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of music into various orders, a manifold gradation of musical skill. In America we have rap, rock, classical, and country. In Korea we have K-pop and everything else; in almost all of these musical genres, again, subordinate gradations.\n\nThe modern pop music that has sprouted from the ruins of rock has not done away with bad rap. It has but established new bad rap, new conditions of bad rappers, new forms of struggle in place of old ones.\n\nOur epoch, the epoch of the pop music, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified bad music. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other - pop and rap.\n\nFrom the rock of the 1970s sprang the-\n\nGonna leave it off here for now.

    "content": "College essays. Should you write them? Absolutely! Do you want to write them? Answers vary, but I say no. The NCEWSOVIPs (National College Essay Writing Society Of Very Important People) also says no. According to a study done in 2011 in a waste management lab in northeastern Wyoming (population 8), only 50% of students who wrote college essays got into college whereas 75% of students who didn\u2019t write essays got into their top choice college!\n\nTrust me, the numbers don\u2019t lie. And, if you don\u2019t believe me, I have a personal story to soften your heart. I also have your social security number to blackmail you with.\n\nOne day I came home from school to find a note taped to my door. Written in comic sans font size 14, I quickly realized that the sender was in distress. I snatched it off my door ignoring the paint that came off with it (my door is from Ikea). Scanning the letter quickly with my speed reading skills, obtained through copious amounts of doing the homework while the teacher is collecting it, I got the gist that the student had applied to college and not gotten in!\n![neighbor's note](https://storage.googleapis.com/radish-2bd31.appspot.com/old-assets/college-letter.png \"neighbor's note\")\nAppalled by the non-existent use of spellcheck, I read through my tears, the comic sans blurring my vision. The letter was typed on a bubble tea receipt, and I recoiled in terror at the sight of the blasphemous coffee bubble tea order WITH NO BUBBLES. Nonetheless, I reached into my cold dark heart and found that little shriveled sliver of kindness that allowed me to knock on my neighbor's door and greet the weary 12 year old that opened the door with a teary smile\nFrom what I remember the conversation went something like this:\n\u201cYou got my letter?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I got that horrid receipt of yours.\u201d\n\\*Quizzical look from the dumb child\\*\n\u201cYes, I got it.\u201d I adjusted accordingly.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I get in?\u201d\n\u201cThe simple answer is; because you tried.\u201d\n\u201cWot?\u201d\n\u201cAll these teachers and parents and guidance counselors try to get you to believe that you need to construct a brilliant masterpiece of a personal essay to get into college. And those who say, \u2018just be yourself\u2019 they\u2019re on the right track. But really, your true self doesn\u2019t even want to write a college essay. And does anyone like your true self anyways? The truth is, the simpler the better. So why not go all the way?\u201d\n\u201cWot?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t write an essay.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nThe door slammed in my face and I smiled to myself. I had just changed this kid's life. In a good way. Forever.\n6 years later, I was walking out of my building to see this kid gallivanting about.\n\u201cI got in!\u201d they said to me. \u201cYour advice worked. I didn\u2019t even apply and I got this in the mail!\u201d\nThey flung the paper in front of me. On the top it read: \u201cEVICTION NOTICE: You have been accepted for the \u2018Giving Away Your House For No Reason Program\u2019 (GAYHFNR) and are being evicted. Leave by Monday.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know how to read?\u201d\n\u201cI learned the word \u2018accepted\u2019 just for this day. Thank you for your help. I could\u2019ve never done it without you.\u201d The child flung the flyer in the air again. The red bold of the word EVICTION taunted you.\n\n\u201cSo I was right.\u201d\n\u201cYes. 75% of people who don\u2019t apply to college get in. Thank you!\u201d\n\u201cNo problem. Have a good time at EVICTION college. I hope you get a good dorm room and a nice campus.\u201d You skipped away merrily. After you shared these findings with the world, every school would go bankrupt and you would become rich and famous just like your great grandmother Joe Cheating who invented the concept of cheating on tests in 1782. People would be getting college acceptance letters so often it would exacerbate climate change!",

    "content": "As I wander the streets of New York with my head down, tongue placed firmly against the cement, I wonder why I don\u2019t see more people doing as I do.\n\nIt\u2019s wintertime here in the big city. And I, a humble former-New Jerseyite, am the only one taking advantage of the salty streets that this magnificent city has to offer. What intricate aromas, what coarse, bumpy textures, what stories remain unknown, trapped in the unloved sands of Times Square\u2019s pavement?\n\nOn the walk to school every day, I can taste the fruit-forward notes of where members of The Radish have walked. I experience the exceptional terroir given by Fort Greene, embracing the cracks in the sidewalk imbued with the despair of spilled Rocky\u2019s coffee. The particular dustiness of the ground right outside the school, protected by the scaffolding, sheltered from the elements, is truly unmatched.\n\nAnd yet I never see anyone giving their tongue an exfoliating flavor journey. These days, everyone seems to have their eyes glued to their screens rather than their tongues glued to the pavement.\n\nWhy can\u2019t we go back to the days when people were more flexible, more willing to lock their knees, bend their heads hellward, and test their immune systems? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to get COVID from licking the ground, anyway. COVID is a respiratory illness.\n\nMaybe people are worried about the cement-licking stigma? I mean, sure, I get the occasional odd look as I shuffle about giving the cement a taste, but critics have never known the hint of fleshiness in the last lick of cement before your tongue goes numb.\n\nPerhaps the lack of popularity of this tasting perspective of New York is a lack of information about the sport. I personally believe, however, that the best guide for your sidewalk-tasting exploits is going out and trying sidewalks.\n\nGo taste the intellectually satisfying profile of Wall Street\u2019s streets and relish in the subtle aroma of \u201chow did I get here?\u201d mixed with a healthy dose of imposter syndrome. Ponder the tart tannin finish of the corner where someone got their heart broken. You, too, can get to the point where if you walk to a corner, put on a blindfold, and taste the ground, you\u2019ll be able to tell exactly where the sidewalk you licked has been.\u00a0\n\nAll you need is a tongue and a dream to get started with sidewalk tasting.",

    "content": "One of the many courses offered here at BTHS is orchestra, which can be found on the ninth floor. Unfortunately, this floor can only be accessed from the west side elevators, as there are no other sides to it. Freshman student Willimina Williams tried to use an east side staircase on her first day of class, but instead of finding violins, she found a portal to the twelfth dimension.\n\"It was my first day of school,\" says Billy Bill, \"and I really wanted to join the orchestra as a subcontrabassist.\" Billy knew next to nothing about the school's programs, so she initially believed this portal to be standard. She was later told that portals are an uncommon occurrence for orchestra and are much more customary for chorus. Even chorus alumnus Charbus Evans said, \u201cWe rarely see portals beyond the ninth dimension... eleven was actually our old record.\" \nShe carried her 0.0669643 imperial ton instrument up to the ninth floor, but, to her dismay, did not find her classroom. Instead, she found a corridor containing what looked to be a \"really weird floating Windows XP logo.\" This rift was apparently the entrance to a new world. In this world, Billiards reports having seen a host of strange things. Oddly, in this weird dimension, the Survey was more well-liked than the obviously superior newspaper, The Radish. \nWilliams, unfortunately, went back through the portal and used the appropriate stairwell to get to class. Since then, the school has prevented any other students from reaching the ninth floor this way by ripping out that side of the building and replacing it with scaffolding. The Radish is currently trying to get an agent up to the portal's corridor, now colloquially known as \u201cToby,\" or \"Tobiathan\" for the fancy. \n",

    "issue": "january-2022",
    "content": "I\u2019ve heard a bunch of buzz going around regarding PupilPath recently. So, today, I have decided to see what all the hype is about.\n\nAt first, PupilPath just seemed like yet another schooling/education-related app-type thing floating around in an oversaturated market. I\u2019ve managed to rise above so far without checking my amazing grades. But with everyone talking about it, with all this fresh hype, I have finally caved to the forces of peer pressure. \u201cWhy not,\u201d I thought. And so, today, for the first time in my academic career, I have downloaded PupilPath.\nFirst things first, anyone telling you about PupilPath being hacked, taken down, or suffering from a security breach, is full of crap. It opened instantly when I pulled it up on the PC I built myself. That is all a lie Big Student has constructed to hide their subpar grades. Those people must be so sad, so shameful not being able to pull a 225% or more in every class like I do. I've never tried to imagine what life would be like without my superior, non-PupilPath-opening intellect, but now, viewing my vastly superior grades, I pity them.\nThose \u201cscreenshots\u201d of down PupilPath are either a case of acceptable photoshop or an issue regarding the user\u2019s level of skill. If you can\u2019t open a little URL without getting an error message, I fear for what your experience will be like in the real world. Personally, the only error message I have ever gotten using PupilPath was when I opened up my AP classes\u2019 grades and got an error message stating \u201cTOO_GOATED_S+_OVERFLOW,\u201d but that was easily resolvable via an administrator rewrite.\nSecond of all, the formatting is godly. I can easily navigate through all of its versatile information systems. I can look at my average and all of the positive things teachers have said about me on my report cards and in real life. I can even look at my only zeros: absences and suspensions.\nThirdly, the feature where you can delete a bunch of random grade data from PupilPath is really funny. I was bored so I did a little exploration. I just went Ctrl + F and replaced some kids\u2019 low grades with \u201ctrolled >:).\u201d To be honest, everyone should be thankful I went and messed with your 0% and 69% grades. I expected someone to have done this sooner considering the big green button in the upper left-hand corner that says \u201cMess around with other people\u2019s averages.\u201d\nThus, my review concludes. PupilPath is not only an efficient grading app, but an entertaining game as well, allowing superior beings like myself to mess with the averages of those other, average kids.",

I paid $1.25, but they gave me two bags of chips\u2014which, if you didn\u2019t know, is worth $2.50. Which is twice as much as I paid. And, y\u2019know, $1.25 for a whole bag of chips?

    "issue": "march-2021",
    "content": "Many people know a bit about the history of the Roman Empire, but have you heard of that other empire across the Mediterranean from them? Carthage isn\u2019t too well-known nowadays. History is written by the winners. That should mean that the Romans wouldn\u2019t record much about Carthage; they razed its capital, right? But what if Rome was the defeated one all along? \nSure, Rome had some things going for it, such as people who liked being in armies and some very good pizza. But are you trying to tell me that thousands of soldiers and war elephants, led by the legendary general Hannibal Barca, lost to a bunch of pizza army people? There\u2019s no way. Carthage must have defeated Rome and razed its own city, writing that they had been eradicated. They then slid behind the scenes of history.\nI know it sounds absurd. I wouldn\u2019t believe myself either. Why would Carthage raze their own city? Usually that\u2019s not what you want to be doing. In fact, we have reason to believe that 98% of the people who win wars don\u2019t raze their own cities. But every empire ends, and the Carthaginains knew this. They must have decided to end on their own terms.\nHowever, there is one hole in this theory. Our hole is Byzantium. Somehow, a great city was made, but who could have built it? How would we be expected to believe that Rome decided to move? That\u2019s outrageous. If you had a great city expertly positioned on the coast, but not too close to the coast, as legends say Rome was, would you just leave? And don\u2019t even start with the pretending that the Goths had any impact on those \u201cRomans.\u201d Besides the Carthaginains, they were one of the greatest military forces in history. We are looking into a theory that Jesus built Byzantium as a holy city, but seeing as he was dead at the time, we\u2019re not so sure about this. Our working theory is that it was founded by the Germans, or possibly some members of the Macedonian empire.\nFast forward to 1492: Christopher Columbus wants to go to India, but he needs money. If only there were an organization that wanted to expand the wealth of Europe while destroying and oppressing native people. Oh wait, Carthage. That\u2019s right, Carthage funded Columbus. Who whispered in Amerigo Vespucci\u2019s ear that he was on a new continent and not Marco Polo\u2019s India? Carthage. Speaking of which, who told Marco Polo to go to India? Can you guess? You\u2019ll never guess. It was Carthage.\nThen, four hundred years later, are we to believe that the great general Napoleon was defeated by some British guy? Even after some failed campaigns in Russia, he could still outmaneuver a Briton. But not Carthage, which famously had some of the greatest military minds in history. Seeing a pattern yet? \nEven Friedreich Engels was famously a Carthage enthusiast, according to <a href=\"https://friedrich-engels-was-a-carthage-enthusiast.pizza\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">friedrich-engels-was-a-carthage-enthusiast.pizza</a>. \nJohn F. Kennedy was a descendant of one of the founders of the \u201cCarthaged\u201d Roman Republic. Lee Harvey \u201cCarthage\u201d Oswald took him out. \nThe moon landing wasn\u2019t faked, but its goal was. The moon landing was so that a Carthagian space research station could eventually be established. \nCarthagians also established a secret wing below the White House they call the \u201cdeep state.\u201d They snuck into the archives there to try and find the file with Obama\u2019s last name. \nThere are still many questions about this sinister force. Were they responsible for the death of the Macedonian Chad, Alexander? Did they sabotage Major Tom\u2019s spaceship? Was Shakespeare in on the Carthaginian conspiracy? Did Carthage invent birds, or do those actually not exist, despite discoveries from our December issue? If you had to pick one, is yogurt a solid or a liquid? These questions may never be answered, but one thing is for certain- \nthey've found me. Goodbye.\n",

    "content": "We\u2019ve all been there. It\u2019s Christmas eve, the in-laws are coming at 9 a.m. tomorrow, and you\u2019re all out of argument starters. Last year you tried religion, Trump, etc. You even swallowed your pride and argued about whether hot dogs are sandwiches or not\u2014and did the impossible by not punching your brother for saying it\u2019s a taco. I hate you, Hank. You aren\u2019t special, you got one tennis racket and fifteen bucks in grandma\u2019s will, just like the rest of us. Anyway. Don\u2019t worry about what arguments you\u2019re starting this year! We\u2019ve got six argument starters that are sure to get your uncle dramatically pointing and screaming.\n1. \u201cIs climate change fun enough?\u201d\n   Screw the age-old \u201cis it real\u201d argument. Here we take a look at if it\u2019s hot or not.\n   Pro-fun arguments include: \u201cThose wildfires got more people moving than your average EDM record\u201d and \u201cOh, NYC will be underwater? Universal water polo.\u201d\n\n   Anti-fun arguments include: \u201cIt has no chill\u201d and \u201cHurricanes and floods? \\*snort or demeaning chuckle/scoff\\* Wake me up when something explodes.\u201d\n\n   Note: This argument is extra fun with a climate scientist at the table.\n2. \u201cCheck out my new favorite album! It\u2019s very experimental.\u201d\n   Your choice of genre, but experimental noise hip-hop, lo-fi trap bedroom pop, and ambient cat noises are always good, controversial choices. Get ready for exasperated groans, and make sure someone chooses to die on the \u201cthere is no way you can call that music\u201d hill. Your republican uncle will have a field day with this one.\n3. \u201cWhich Frankish king was hotter: Theudebert II or Sigebert I?\u201d\n   Your weird cousin will for sure go with Theudebert II. His whole side of the family will agree. Go with Sigebert I, he\u2019s the bad boy of the two. You are for sure gonna get some hatred and heated debate going.\n4. (Directed towards your aunt/uncle and their spouse) \u201cSo which one of you is the chill one and which one is the lame one?\u201d\n   Make sure their kids take sides for this one; some serious long term damage is sure to come out of it. A good version of this argument is incredibly passive-aggressive. If it\u2019s not, you can throw in an \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re very different in a more social setting\u201d and an uptight \u201cMhm!\u201d\n5. Throw something and blame an adult.\n   This one is simple. It\u2019s an aggressive approach, but it gets the job done nicely. For optimal results, make it something precious and fragile.\n6. \u201cWho here can make the best owl noise?\u201d\n   Loud, aggressive, and horrible owl noises are the perfect for you to make. Insist you\u2019re the best, but make an awful and completely unrealistic owl noise. This works well with a co-conspirator to defend you and gaslight the whole family. Be careful here. This gets very heated very quickly.\nHave fun with your arguments people. And make sure you don\u2019t get injured\u2014disarming every family member at the door yields the safest results. Pro tip: if your family tends to resort to fists, disarm them of those, too. Happy arguing everyone!",

    "content": "Everyone has seen a list. Whether your parents gave you a bunch of chores or a recipe wanted more eggs, you have used them. Why do recipes keep asking for so many eggs? I need to keep lists for my egg lists. There are too many lists. You just can\u2019t escape their dominance over human culture, no matter what corner of the earth you run to. Just try. You can run but you can\u2019t hide from them. Even eggs are being used as list propaganda. It\u2019s getting bad.\n\nI digress. Without further adieu, here are the top 10 reasons why lists are bad.\n1. Lists always have 12 items, just like egg cartons. Why eggs?\n2. Lists can be mass-produced.\n3. Listing is not an original idea and neither are eggs. Get over the eggs already.\n4. Lists are forgettable and it\u2019s hard to keep track of how many items one has.\n5. A list is never finished. You do one thing and there\u2019s always something more. Where are the items coming from? I don\u2019t remember wanting to get more eggs-\n6. Lists are informal.\n7. It keeps you focused on a select few ideas. Like eggs.\n8. Lists are not funny. Also like eggs.\n9. They remind me too much of eggs and brainstorming projects.\n10. There is no reason anyone should be using a list; there are many superior formats. You have Venn diagrams, sticky notes, doodles, and eggs, to name a few.\n11. They\u2019re lazy. (Eggs.)\n12. Get more eggs.\n\nDo you agree with me? List your reasons why in a comment on <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/theradishbths/\">our Insta</a>!",

    "authors": ["phoenix-thorwall"],
    "issue": "june-2022",
    "content": "<!--StartFragment-->\nTo the surprise of the entire male student body, the Collegeboard sent an email regarding an AP exam that no one signed up for\u2026\nNo one was going to pass up a free chance of getting another credit for college admissions, but why did only the boys get this special opportunity?\nOddly enough, the ticket to this exam told students to head to a boys bathroom in the northeast section of the building on any floor.\nUpon arriving, all the proctors were members of the custodial staff.\n\nThen, the boys were given several minutes to perform three tasks: urinate in a urinal, urinate in a toilet and urinate in a sink.\n\nAt first, the boys were appalled, especially those who were less physically endowed. How were they able to aim for the sink if their small, teeny little wee-wees couldn\u2019t be moved because they were so tiny and sunken? But as the exam went on, many realized why the exam was necessary\u2014and why they wouldn\u2019t pass.\n\nA boy tried to go to the bathroom to look at his cheat sheet, but to no avail- he was already in the bathroom. The custodians had locked the door and shut the windows. There was no escape from the inevitable.\n\nIt was such an exhausting task. There\u2019s only so much pee to spare in the body. One boy wept, \u201cI literally don\u2019t drink water. Like, ever. What do you want me to spray out?\u201d\n\nBy the end of the test, the ceiling was covered in urine. The boys were more exhausted than after any AP exam they\u2019d ever taken. Their confidence and bladders were drained. After taking a survey, the majority of boys say they would rather have taken a DBQ from a subject they\u2019ve never studied for than pass and get the credit for this exam. One response described it as \u201cmore painful than getting hit in the crotch.\u201d We put that to the test.\nWe got the chance to interview these local heroes for more insight into this new policy.\nOver the years, custodians have had growing concerns for the future of humanity:\n\u201cWe may be the engineers, but none of the boys seem to know how to flush a toilet.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do we let our students get recruited for the military when they can\u2019t even aim in a urinal?\u201d\nThis is a proficiency exam to see whether or not the boys of Brooklyn Tech really do deserve their bathroom privileges. If enough people fail, the boys bathroom will be shut down and funds (as well as room space and delicious water) will be allocated to people who actually deserve it. Like the bagel club. Boys will have to fight for the chance to use the small 3 minute window where a couple isn\u2019t occupying the gender neutral bathroom.\nGirls on the other hand, know the ins and outs of bathroom etiquette. This is why the girls' bathrooms have vending machines and massage chairs on the inside.\n\nSneaky Tips From The Radish:\n* For a 5 pee in the proctor's mouth! They give you free diapers.\n* For a 4 pee like a normal human person like it\u2019s literally not even that hard. You pass. Passably.\n* For a 3 you just have to not piss your pants because come on can you not even do that? You\u2019re on thin ice they're gonna watch you pee with cameras they're watching right now do a good job\n* For a 2 you have to be absolutely pathetic. You didn\u2019t even pee. No more bathroom for you in the school ever. What would you even do in there? Be sad and lonely?\n\n* For a 1 you have to be pissing on the walls and the ceilings and the rims. Can you not control your pee hole? Is it like a cave full of crystals and stones? What is happening, bro? Bathroom privileges revoked, obviously. Plus they\u2019re taking away your bladder too.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->",

I was quick to come to the conclusion that the cause of my pain was clear: school desks.\nSchool desks have been ruining the mental and physical health of students for decades, ever since the invention of the chair in 1968. It\u2019s time that we removed them from our school.\n**The Evidence Speaks For Itself:**\nIn an experiment conducted by me last Tuesday, I found that the desks have been physically deforming me and other students, contorting us into freaks. At the start of the school year, I was a spry 7\u20195 with a promising career in the NBA (Nice Boys of America). Now 6 months later, I have gone to a mere 4'2, with all my hopes and dreams crushed, similarly to the disks in my spine.\n\nMy back compressed, my dreams gone, and my ass flat. These desks have permanently mangled my body.\n\nIn hopes to be cured of my condition, I went to my doctor to see what he had to say. Immediately after taking an X-ray, my doctor called up the Natural History Museum to tell them he found the link between man and primate. I didn't have the heart to tell him that I was just a Brooklyn Tech student.\n**A Health Hazard on Par With Chernobyl:**\nIf there is one word best to describe the desks at tech, it would be \u201csticky\u201d. Any quick look at these desks can tell you, there is more gum than desk. Approximately 65% gum to 30% desk. The remaining 5% is pure evil. I have lost books to the raspberry flavored adhesive on these desks, often I\u2019m afraid it may rip off skin. You know that scene in Spider-Man when Peter Parker gets his lunch stuck to his hands? It\u2019s kinda like that but instead of the Green Goblin it\u2019s my physics teacher and I don't have spider powers.\nBased on my \u201ccalculations,\u201d there is more saliva collected on a typical desk than there is in an average human\u2019s mouth. The pure bacteria just on the seat could absolutely tear through any immune system like wildfire. Before we know it, the bacteria will eat through the steel of the desk and leave nothing but gum.\n**Several OSHA Violations:**\nHave you ever seen a desk with perfectly even legs? No, because they don\u2019t exist. At any moment the desk could either tip over or combust under your weight. If you look close enough, you may notice desks missing literal screws. Seriously, some desks are just missing parts of structural integrity. For a school that prides itself on engineering, we may as well be sitting on stilts.\n\nIn addition, the desks are home to vandalization and pictures inappropriate for school. No learning building should have such evil imagery. One day, I came across a desk painted with several crude attempts at male genitalia. By golly! I would have fainted on the spot. And that I did, as my legs could not support my ape-like posture. Such terrible drawings have no place at such a prestigious school. If we have no desks, there would be no surface for malicious illustrations. Instead draw on your classroom\u2019s whiteboards, your teachers will love it!\n**My Proposal:**\nYou may be thinking, \u201cB- But what will we sit on?\u201d\n\nWell I come to you with my revolutionary idea: The Class Hammock (Patent Pending)\nInstead of individual seats, the whole class will share a giant-sized hammock in the middle of the class, spanning from wall to wall of the room. There will be one pillow and it\u2019s first-come, first-serve.\nYou may be thinking (again), \u201cB- But thats t- totally impractical\u201d\n\nShut up. That's the point.\nThank you for listening to my \u201cRAD Talk\u201d. I will be accepting questions after 10th period behind a dumpster, I will not say which one. Reach out to me at 555-DESK to learn more about our fight.\n\nWill you stand against desks?",

    "content": "\u201cIt all started when I was hanging out with some buddies on my friend Chuck's farm,\u201d said Dale, the man who has been single-handedly reversing the effects of climate change on our atmosphere by inhaling the exhaust fumes produced by our vehicles.\n\n> My pal Rusty Mike said, \u201cHey, Dale, I bet you won\u2019t put your mouth on my tractor\u2019s exhaust pipe.\u201d Obviously, I did, and it felt\u2026 good?\n\nWhat happened next sent him on a slippery slope of self-discovery.\n\n> He turned to me and he said, \u201cYou know you can take your mouth off the pipe now, right?\u201d I did take my mouth off the pipe, only to look at him and say, \u201cNo!\u201d then put it back on the pipe. Then I inhaled the air. It was like a warm summer breeze that tasted like cotton candy. It was something beautiful, really.\n\nWe reached out to Dale\u2019s friend Eric for his comments on this.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with him,\u201d he said. \u201cOne minute we were hanging around Chuck\u2019s farm and the next he\u2019s sucking on every tractor pipe he can get his hands on.\u201d\n\nEven though they may sound insane, Dave\u2019s actions might not be as absurd as they sound. Experts say Dale\u2019s antics could have a significant impact on helping the Earth\u2019s climate.\n\n\u201cAccording to my calculations he\u2019s been inhaling approximately 200,000 kilograms of carbon dioxide every single day,\u201d said Alfred Pipe, head of The National Institute of Pipe Sucking, or NIPS. \u201cThat\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\n\nThe diabolical auto industry, the largest contributor of carbon dioxide in the environment, was infuriated by Dale foiling their nefarious plots to poison our atmosphere.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s bad that he\u2019s helping the climate!\u201d Said the CEO of Exxon, John D. Climate Change. \u201cDo none of you see the problem with this?! He\u2019s inhaling exhaust fumes!\u201d When asked why he was fighting against the solution to climate change, he simply shut down. \u201cTHIS ISN\u2019T ABOUT THE CLIMATE ANYMORE! A HUMAN BEING SHOULDN\u2019T BE INHALING THAT AMOUNT OF EXHAUST. ALSO, WHAT DID YOU WRITE MY NAME AS? DOES THAT SAY \u2018JOHN D. CLIMATE CHANGE?! MY NAME IS PHILLIP!\u2019\u201d For shame.\n\nTrue environmentalists, however, are fully on board with Dale\u2019s newfound hobby. \u201cHe\u2019s doing great work,\u201d said Kathy McOils, climate activist and lavender spokeswoman. \u201cHow could anyone be against him? He\u2019s literally like, literally saving the world. Literally.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, medical professionals seem to disagree.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to die if he keeps doing this,\u201d said Doug Stethoscopes, an environment-hating doctor\u2014and man who clearly wants to watch the world burn. \u201cHe\u2019s poisoning himself. He\u2019s passed out three times since the beginning of this interview.\u201d\n\nWe asked Dale to comment on this last remark, but he didn\u2019t respond to our inquiries\u2014or any stimuli whatsoever.\n\nThe Radish would like to formally inform its readers that Dale is perfectly fine and no harm has come of his exhaust-sucking adventures. He was last seen as recently as this morning happily sucking on the exhaust pipe of the ambulance that took him to the hospital three days ago.",

    "content": "Brooklyn tech Is famous for its large student body and its unique academic environment, but not many students are aware of the school\u2019s supernatural side. Have you ever walked down the hall and heard strange echoes? Have you been alone in the basement and seen movement in the shadows? Ever used the bathroom? If you have, you've likely experienced some of BTHS's paranormal properties. Want to learn more about these funky phenomena? Well, now you can! The Radish has put together a handy list of cryptids to guide you on your journey through the halls.\n\n1. The Rat King\n   A mysterious student at Tech calling himself \u201cThe Rat King\u201d has been roaming the basement halls for the past few weeks. He\u2019s been spotted gnawing on school lunches one of his friends smuggles for him from the cafeteria. Witnesses say he\u2019s amassed a horde of rats who follow him around and do his bidding after being fed the school lunch scraps even he can\u2019t bear to eat (He has a sensitive tummy).\n\n2. Boy\u2019s Bathroom Jerry\n\n   Recently a crocodile had made itself at home in the boy\u2019s bathroom on the 4th floor. Some have started calling him Jerry. How he got there we can\u2019t say, but so far he\u2019s been more or less harmless, besides a few rolls of toilet paper getting eaten. Some have begun making offerings to him, flushing food down the toilets while chanting \u201cALL HAIL JERRY!\u201d Offerings range from notebooks to scrambled eggs, and even a pineapple.\n\n3. The Mystery Vending Machine\n   Nobody knows where the mystery vending machine came from, but multiple students claim to have had encounters with it. They all have matching descriptions of it. It\u2019s just like all the others but in red. It only accepts euros, and it gives change in pesos. On the side, it has the description \u201cProperty of the 4th and a half floor.\u201d All witnesses claim to have seen it in different places, some in the basement and others outside the mezzanine or even in the bathrooms. According to one student, if you stare at it for long enough you can hear it scream. Items in the machine are said to include bagged chicken parmigiana, 25 cent watermelons, and a sexy fireman calendar from 1995.\n\n4. The couple that keeps making out in the hallway (Please stop it\u2019s scaring me)\n   There\u2019s nothing cryptic about this, you're just\u2026 kinda doing a lot there in front of a lot of people\u2026\n\n5. Heelie Kid (He\u2019s so fast!)\n\n   Someone\u2019s been zooming through the halls on a set of heelies. He\u2019s going so fast no one\u2019s ever seen his face, just a blur and a pair of shoes. Some students claiming to be his friends say he just finished binge-watching Speed Racer and Cars 2. Rumor has it he\u2019s rolling away from an AP European History test.\n\n6. My advisor (The invisible man)\n\n   I tried to email him but Google said the email address he gave me doesn\u2019t exist. Nobody else in my grade has him as an advisor. If anyone knows Mr. McTeacherface please let me know. I\u2019m currently failing his class.\n\n7. The lunch ladies\n   Nobody knows who they are, but the lunch ladies seem to be everywhere. They check our health screenings, yell at us for not wearing our masks, and give us \u201cfood.\u201d Who are these people who we allow to control our lives? Nobody seems to know. We don\u2019t know where they came from either. According to Mr. Newman they just \u201ccame with the building.\u201d",

    "content": "\u201cJe neauxd un baguette, croissant, aeund wine feaux touniht,\u201d you hear the French person say at the elegant local caf\u00e9. The French language is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, weighing in at somewhere between the first and hundredth most spoken on earth. Despite its widespread use, students are angry about French classes, and a few have started riots. \nBut French teachers are fighting back. Currently 28 students have been wounded in battle by baguettes carved into swords. \nA team of thirteen linguists from Harvard University have come up with a hypothesis that may just change the world\u2019s understanding of the French language. We contacted this team at 26\u00b003'51.2\"N 173\u00b058'01.9\"W via carrier pigeon.\n\u201cYeah, so basically, French isn\u2019t what people think it is. French is really just English, but with a really, really, really strong French accent,\u201d says Louis Dubois, PhD., a member of the linguistics team and a French immigrant now living in the United States. \n> It occurred to me when a hipster called me a \u201cclich\u00e9 human being\u201d for using deodorant. Then and there I realized how similar both languages are and I began to study their similarities. This led to the realization they are the same language. All it takes to start speaking French is to undergo the French initiation process. The abbreviated version involves creating a circle of croissants with a star made of baguettes inside. You then chant: \u201cLe radis me tient en otage, mes coordonn\u00e9es sont cach\u00e9es dans cet article,\u201d which translates to \u201cmake me one with the guillotine.\u201d\n\nHistorian Jules Lefebvre took the time to research and explain how French came to exist and somehow branch out into a whole separate language. \u201cYou see, people don\u2019t realize that France emerged from British defectors. They were disgusted by the usage of Marmite in Britain, and swam across the English Channel and so, they established the Kingdom of France. While the newly-created France was still forming its identity, some of the people started to speak English with a very strange accent to separate themselves from Britain. From this came French. After that, mainstream French history starts. You know, the history \\*that\\* girl who saw Les Mis\u00e9rables obsesses over. Yeah, \\*that\\* French history.\u201d\nAfter learning about this, The Radish has started to protest French classes, calling them \u201ca waste of good time that could be spent establishing communist dictatorships.\u201d Dear readers, spread the news. Tell everyone what the French language truly is. Everyone needs to know. This is The Radish, auexnd oui weuill nout reaust.",

    "content": "You wake up, you eat your bagel with toast, and you pat your ferret three times before hopping onto a crowded subway car. You cram your body into it at the last minute because you\u2019re just that eager to learn.\n\nThe train groans merrily along. Then, you stop. It's the third to last stop and this person with a green North Face puffer is getting on. Their coat is North face because they're basic\u2014but green because they\u2019re not that basic. Their bright yellow Fjallraven kanken backpack is way too brightly colored and definitely too small to fit all their necessities (notebooks, rocks, organs, etc.) The train is cramped and they have to stand. They don\u2019t deserve a seat though. They would probably put their blinding, stupid backpack on their lap if they had a chance instead of the floor where it belongs.\nThis person is here every day. It\u2019s like they are following you. Maybe they are just also \u201cgoing to school,\u201d but almost everyone has an ulterior motive these days and people with white Converse are never to be trusted.\n\nThe train lurches and so does your mysterious stalker.\n\nYou check your watch, a knockoff fit bit because who has the money for those things, and see that you indeed have 3 minutes until school starts.\n\nSitting uneasily, you glare at a baby you were positive was making a face at you first until its mom turns the stroller around. You think about why that baby looked like a little Ed Sheeran and contemplate telling its mother but realize that she would probably be offended. I mean it\u2019s sad enough her child is a ginger. And you\u2019re pretty sure you heard her call the child \u201cMark.\u201d Weird. You thought people were becoming less basic. Then you remember the green North Face jacket person and turn your head to the side.\n\nAnd there they are. Green as ever. Your legs are moving before you know it (you knew you shouldn\u2019t have eaten that day-old bologna.) Funnily enough, now you\u2019re standing in front of them.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d you say, surprised at yourself.\n\u201cUhh... hi?\u201d They seem scared of you. Weirdo.\n\nYou blank. Words no longer exist in this realm of thinking. Mushy nothingness fills your brain like that chocolate milk that flooded the school last week. You stutter out something about leaving your stove on but realize you don\u2019t know how to cook. Making friends on subway trains is not ideal. Making friends is not ideal. Friends in general are not ideal.\n\nYou back away and the heel of your shoe hits young Ed Sheeran's stroller. You fall. This is a new realm; the Fjallraven Kanken yellow flashes in your peripheral, nightmares of Hydro Flasks being stuffed into tiny backpacks fill your mind as you topple. You hear the mother yell out \u201cMark\u201d and you mentally confirm how ugly that name sounds as a yell. As you fall the train begins to move.\n\nGreen puffer coat person helps you up and the mother glares at you.\n\nYour stop is finally here. As you exit the train, with a newfound sense of courage you tell the mother that her child resembles Ed Sheeran but that she shouldn\u2019t worry too much. She shakes her head, not knowing who dear Ed is.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s an \u2018Ed?\u2019\u201d She asks and you just walk away. You wait for puffer coat person on the platform but they walk right past you.\n\nMaking friends on the subway is great! That was great! It\u2019s gonna be a great day\u2014and you will never see those people ever again.",

    "title": "Socially Distanced Sports: New Rules",
    "authors": ["nicholas-di-girolamo"],
    "issue": "december-2020",
    "content": "Coronavirus has changed many aspects of life recently, such as how we play sports. For many, sports were the only thing keeping them from becoming just another obesity statistic. When looking for something new to stay in shape, many will tell you, \u201cTake up jogging\u201d or \u201ccreate a bodyweight workout routine\u201d or \u201cfight a new Beowulf-esque monster every day.\u201d But, if you\u2019re like me, those options aren't enough.\u00a0\n\nI crave sports. I miss debating the referee about my alleged \u201closs.\u201d I miss the adrenaline rush from calling a hit on your opponent(s). Trying to outrun the police cars was like my own personal Formula 1 race. Plus, I was clearly doing something right; my walls are lined with participation trophies, medals, certificates, and even some t-shirts.\n\nThere\u2019s no replacement for the rush you get from playing sports. So, instead of this whole \u201cworking out\u201d thing, I made some revisions to many popular sports\u2019 rules so that they are sanitary and socially distanced.\n\nAlso, before you ask: no, I am not accepting criticism. I am, however, accepting donations to my CashApp at $SportsLover69420.\n\n## Ping pong\n\nYou may be thinking, \u201cWhy do we need to change the rules of ping pong? Aren\u2019t the players far enough already?\u201d That assumption would make sense since a regulation ping pong table is nine feet long. However, with these rules and regulations, the athletes would still need to wear masks. And, as we all know, ping pong requires a lot of aerobic activity and it is very easy to get out of breath while playing. For this reason, I propose doubling the length of the table so that athletes may play unmasked.\n\n## Swimming\n\nThere are two options for swimming.\u00a0\n\nThe first (and preferred) option is for each competitor to buy an Olympic-size swimming pool. This option allows athletes to train and compete any time they like\u2014and it teaches them important skills when it comes to cleaning pools, a career that many swimmers pursue.\n\nThe second option is using public pools. One downside to this option is that public pools are not suitable for training\u2014only competitions.\n\nCompetitions work by having one competitor compete in each of their disciplines. They are given a one-minute break between disciplines, which should be ample time to rest. Once one competitor has competed in all of their disciplines, the pool is drained, sanitized, and refilled. After that, the next competitor competes in all of their disciplines. This is repeated for each competitor. The cycle should take approximately one week per person. One full set of races takes approximately fifty-two weeks; one year.\n\n## Sumo wrestling\n\nSumo wrestling was hard to adapt to be socially distant since it requires a lot of physical contact. However, I finally figured out a solution: each wrestler gets into their own bubble ball and seals themselves inside. This does not allow COVID-19 to spread; there is no way for air to get in or out of the bubble ball.\u00a0\n\nWhen fighting, instead of slamming into each other, the wrestlers try pushing their opponent over the boundaries. This can happen if their opponent falls in their bubble, thus making them roll away. One can also win by outlasting their opponent, seeing as both athletes are slowly suffocating inside their bubbles.\n\n## Volleyball\n\nSo far, in order to keep these sports safe, I have increased the size of the playing area, installed sanitary regulations, and used a new, more effective particle blocker. But, with volleyball, I have decided it\u2019s best to just remove players from both teams. Instead of being played 6v6, it is now played 1v1. The court area stays the same so what was guarded by six people will now be guarded by one. This extra space gives players enough room to play safely without masks.\n\n## American Football\n\nAmerican football will be played with mostly the same rules. However, since players must stay socially distant, each player will be equipped with a paintball gun. Instead of tackling players of the opposing team, athletes will shoot them with the paintball guns. If the player that is currently in possession of the ball is shot, the play is over. Players may dive in front of the paintballs in order to protect their teammates, but if they are shot, they must lie on the grass for the remainder of the play.\n\n## Soccer\n\nSince everyone knows that soccer is an unpopular, unimportant sport, this one has a simple solution. Instead of getting on the field and randomly kicking around a ball, you can just play FIFA 21, the new FIFA game which clearly has many visible differences from FIFA 19 and FIFA 20.\n\nNow, all that\u2019s left to do is wait for the various international sports organizations to change the official rules so we can begin. I look forward to participating in all these sports and destroying you all.",

    "title": "Scaffolding Older Than BTHS Building",
    "authors": ["ivy"],
    "issue": "march-2020",
    "content": "An astonished group of students alerted us immediately after it had come to their attention that no one had any idea when the scaffolding surrounding the school had been built. So, deciding that further investigation was warranted, we conducted some interviews.\nFirstly, we asked an elderly Brooklyn Tech alumnus about the scaffolding. When they kindly informed us that the scaffolding had been up throughout their time at Tech, it occurred to us that this might need more investigation than we initially thought. \nWe then interviewed another Tech alumnus. \u201cMy great-grandfather also went to Tech,\u201d she confided in us. \u201cWhen I was a little girl, he once told me that the school's greatest flaw was its covering of scaffolding.\u201d She also told us that her great-grandfather had attended the school in its very early years. In fact, he was part of the third graduating class at Tech.\nThat really proved the point, but we decided some professional help could be useful. Fruitlessly, we tried to contact an archaeologist. But, for some inexplicable reason, everyone we called either didn't pick up or seemed to think that our case was not of the utmost importance. (I mean, come on, who thinks that studying an early site in the Dingwall area of the Scottish Highlands is a more valuable use of their time than investigating the mysteries of a high school\u2019s scaffolding?) Due to this unfortunate delay, students had to wait for the winter to pass to undertake the work themselves. \nA few students worried about floating rumors that the administration could soon be taking the scaffolding down before we could resume the investigation. Fortunately, and as most of us expected, the scaffolding was still up when the warmer weather came. \n\u201cI was determined to get to the bottom of this,\u201d said a student who was determined to get to the bottom of this. The member of the highly professional, student-organized archaeological team spoke with us in a private interview after she had spent a particularly long time staring at the scaffolding from many angles. \nFinally, one pleasant day, a student made a startling discovery. It turned out the drawings on the north side of the building were actually ancient cave carvings. With this discovery, they thought back to freshmen year world history class. And, with their vague memories from that class, they deciphered that the carvings depicted scaffolding in the shape of Brooklyn Tech. \n![Ancient scaffolding depiction](https://storage.googleapis.com/radish-2bd31.appspot.com/old-assets/ancient-scaffolding-depiction.png \"Ancient scaffolding depiction\")\nSamples sent out to a reputable carbon-dating site were carbon-dated to 2500 BCE. (Take that, early Scottish site in the highlands!) After that stunning revelation, the archaeological team alerted the school administration of their discovery. In response, due to OSHA regulations prohibiting the use of sketchy ancient scaffolding, Tech called a scaffolding company to tear down the old scaffolding. \nTech students rejoiced, for the school had been darkened by the monstrous scaffolding for so long. But when the students returned from summer break, they were met with a terrible sight: the scaffolding had been torn down, only to be replaced! \nSo, now, despite extensive protests, the scaffolding is rumored to be scheduled for another few years. However, many students have questions as to what \u201ca few years\u201d really means. Some have even taken to writing to future students on the scaffolding. \nThese times seem dark, but maybe someday in the distant future, there will be hope for taking down the scaffolding.",

    "content": "Gertrude is a well-dressed, kind-hearted mother of three in her early 40\u2019s.\n\nOne Thursday afternoon, she drove her Toyota Hybrid Minivan to pick up her kids from school. She was early; she makes a point of being punctual. This afternoon, rather than wait at the front entrance and chat with her gal pals, Gertrude decided to treat herself to some pistachio ice cream next to the schoolyard.\n\nThen, it happened. She saw her kids talking to some friends and overheard one say, \u201cYo mama is so ugly that when she tried to join an ugly contest they said, \u2018Sorry, no professionals.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, the classic \u2018yo mama\u2019 joke,\u201d Gertrude thought to herself. She felt sorry for whoever's kids had to get dealt a sick burn like that about their loser mom. But then Gertrude remembered: those poor, insulted kids were hers. Adding two and two together, she made four with the realization that she was, in fact, the loser mom. Mascara and tears dripping down her face, Gertrude dropped her ice cream and ran\u2014but shortly returned after remembering she still had to take her kids home.\n\nEveryone has been hit with a \u201cyo mama\u201d joke at least once in their life. Most people rub it off with a \u201cnice one, Jared\u201d or \u201cyeah, my mom is pretty ugly LOL (Laugh Out Loud).\u201d But have we ever stopped to consider the mama behind the yo? How many mothers have been traumatized from this exact scenario? Well, for the first time ever, The Radish has a sponsor (our treasurer has proven to be incapable of procuring any funds). Here\u2019s a big thank you from the Radish to the Yo Mama (Your Mother) Rehabilitation Center For Mothers Who Have Been Severely Roasted (Otherwise known as YMRCFMWHBSR).\nWhile you may have your suspicions, you can trust the YMRCFMWHBSR that your mother will be handled with the utmost care. Our mission is to nurture that battered and bruised mama bear spirit. The state-of-the-art YMRCFMWHBSR facility includes swimming pools, jacuzzi, and lounging at a 5 star restaurant. However, the actual magic happens at the group therapy sessions, where mothers get intense affirmations and meditative training.\nAn Oxford study has provided the following research from field testing:\n\u201c8/10 mothers who have been \u201cyo mama\u2019d\u201d have showcased lack of energy, self-confidence, and productivity. The victim's body neglects any sense of maternal instinct in an attempt to deflect any \u201cyo mama\u201d jokes.\n\u201cAnother 7/10 mothers developed obsessions with the moment of attack. One common symptom: compulsively returning to the scene of the incident and muttering the sick punchline under their breath.\u201d\nIf that doesn\u2019t motivate you to get your mother rehabilitated, then think of the bigger picture. Without mothers, who will remind the world\u2019s children to eat their vegetables? Our simulations forecast the global gross domestic product going down by 2 percent. Purchases of all vegetables have been decreasing exponentially. Upon leaving the facility, your mother will walk into the world with a clear conscious, revitalized self-image, and a shiny pair of noise-cancelling headphones to drown out any pests.",

We hope you understand.\nThe 10th floor houses replicas of the most magical items on Earth, including but not limited to:\n* <span class=\"blacked-out\">Adjklasjdoajodjqwopdqwodjqopjdopqwjdopqwjdpoqwjdopqwjdopqwjwdopqjdwopqjdpoqjdpoqjdpojqpodwpojdqwpodjqwpodjwpdqpojdqpojdwqpodjqpo</span>supermarket coupon<span class=\"blacked-out\">slkajdlkajsdklajkl</span>\n* <span class=\"blacked-out\">askldjlaksjdlkajskldjaklsjdlajsdjoasjdopasjdpoadpoasdpoja ..</span>\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588eggs.\nEnticing list items, so how does one reach them? Well, to conduct the ritual needed to reach the floor, you will need a pair of Air Jordans, three leather-bound books, and a cozy spot in the school\u2019s northeast stairwell. Stand on top of the books while wearing the Jordans. Then, according to Wizardy for dummies:\n\u201cSlide to thy left and then slide to thy right. Once thy has completed those steps, thy shall move backwards. After hopping once, thou shalt stomp thy left foot and then thy right. Cha cha real smooth.\u201d\nUpon entering the 10th floor, expect to feel a sense of queasiness and a strengthened desire to sign up for every AP class. The three leather-bound books from the ritual will be taken by your Air Jordans to the giant library on the eastern side of the floor.\n\nIn this library, shelves of books reach up to the ceiling and\u2014the weirdest part\u2014there are computers for everyone. Nobody is there, but it\u2019s the thought that counts.\n\nDown the hallway, there is an inverted black pyramid hanging from the roof, said to be a source of <span class=\"blacked-out\">fuckfuckfcuksakdasald.</span>. This pyramid looks like the one on the dollar bill, raising the question: is BTHS connected to the Illuminati or <span class=\"blacked-out\">New Providence</span>? Since there aren\u2019t computers on the 10th floor, our researchers have not binged it yet. Sad, but we may never know.\nBeyond the pyramid lies the south side of the 10th floor. Here there is a structure many describe as an escalator to heaven. If you walk up the escalator, you will come face-to-face with Jesus Christ, creator of PupilPath. Jesus will look at your grades. If you have below an 85 in any of your classes, the devil will steal your PC and damn you to the eternal hell of BW6.\n\nIf you pass Jesus\u2019s examination, you will receive an \u201cunsuspiciously\u201d ticking package three days after you leave the 10th floor.

    "content": "With Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson, and Johnson vaccines being spooned into the mouths, arms, and hearts of millions, vaccination rates are skyrocketing. With the introduction of a new vaccine, produced by Production of Manufacturing Pharmaceutical Products Industries Incorporated Inc. LLC, that rate is only gonna get higher and higher. This vaccine truly is an exciting new development that has all the epidemiologists saying \u201cWowza!\u201d in a good way.\nThe name of the new vaccine is still up to debate and is in the process of being decided by an internet poll. Currently, the name \u201cVaccinations are a scam created by Jill Biden and her team of sentient lizards\u201d is in the lead.\n\nThis vaccine is also still in the early stages of testing. Currently, it\u2019s only being tested on small rodents, members of the CTC, and my sister. These tests have been unsuccessful so far; side effects include dizziness, forgetfulness, dizziness, comas lasting five to six weeks, and being easily distracted by shiny objects, like that fork on my desk.\n\nThe pharmaceutical company that created the vaccine boasts a 200% effectiveness rate. So, when the vaccinated individual foolishly catches COVID, they gain bonus abilities. These abilities include resistance to fire and bullets, digesting rocks, and being able to tell the difference between two dogs of the same breed. The 200% effectiveness rate was entirely derived from tests on an employee named Jeffery, who may or may not have had these abilities before.\n\nSide effects on non-Jeffery participants include anxiety, paranoia, and sleepwalking, as well as a blinking red light in their arm, which Bill Gates has insisted is just a pimple.\nAnti-vaxxers have had a field day with this new vaccine, and Facebook\u2019s servers have reported a 68% increase in stinky takes running through their servers. However, many have been disappointed.\n\nA local negligent parent, who has asked to stay anonymous and uninformed, has called the vaccine boring. \u201cI just wish this vaccine was harmless like the other ones. There\u2019s no fun when the vaccine\u2019s makers do the work of making it look bad for you. I miss the Pfizer days, days when you could claim that life-saving medicine was responsible for the Iraq war.\u201d\nDoctors around the world have petitioned this vaccine, calling it dangerously cool. But no matter the side effects, experts are excited by this promisingly new option for vaccine-seekers, even if it\u2019s only to make the other vaccines look even better.\n",

    "content": "\"Stop slowly killing the planet-before it kills us.\" At least, that's what people are repeatedly saying. But it's not right for anyone to say this without a complete understanding of the issue, even if they seem possessed. There are too few people telling us of the planet's actual revenge plot. Too few people are looking at the facts. Most people will be sure to offer some helpful notes about the changing Earth. Most people will say something about carbon dioxide warming the Earth, et cetera, et cetera. However, this statement is vague. \nObviously, the amount of carbon in the atmosphere is rising and there is something to blame. But if you look closely, you'll see how this is (conveniently) happening as the human population grows! Where most people stray from the truth is from a bias towards wanting to be human. They say that we are causing the carbon emissions. However, that's simply untrue: we are carbon.\nThe dinosaurs must have done destruction to their world. They must have disrupted a balance with their massive existence. They must have uprooted a lot of trees. The universe likes trees. All the biggest dinosaurs died. Yet all we do is rearrange this world. We messed up a balance-a balance restored after the dinosaurs were killed off. We might all be uprooted from this life anytime now, just as the dinosaurs were. Despite this, hope isn't lost for the human race. If we're good the planet might now have to hire a hitman, but we can talk about planetary conspiracies another time. How to be good? We should turn into trees. \nTrees were around with the dinosaurs, trees were around with everything thereafter. We exist with trees, but what if they were our existence? If carbon emissions are the problem, how can we live as humans? The planet's saying we won't-for much longer. \nIf we all turn into trees, the global climate disaster will be fixed. Instead of restoring forests, think more: become the forest. It's not complicated: humans bad, trees good. \nUltimately, that's why we all must turn into trees. Or, at the very least, a radish. On another note... I hope this gets printed on some nice paper.",

    "content": "Last month, notorious mobster Fettuccine Alfredo Cannoli (alias \u201cBig Boy\u201d) was found guilty of bribery, tax evasion, and drug trafficking, alongside 68.7* other charges. He was sentenced to life in prison. Big Boy could have gotten a lesser sentence if he had given federal investigators the names of his fellow gang members, but he remained loyal. Reportedly,  he had said \u201cSnitches get stitches.\u201d So his situation makes sense.\nDespite this, investigators were absolutely baffled when they found Cannoli\u2019s holding cell empty. \u201cAll that was left was the smell of pasta,\u201d says Detective Chunky \u201cThe Chunkster\u201d Ratatouille. \nFortunately, the CIA was able to track Cannoli\u2019s movements. Using a certain technology we\u2019re not allowed to reveal to the public, we now know that Mr. Cannoli is somewhere around Rome, Italy. Investigators thought he was in Vatican City. So, they planned a way to capture him. But while they were planning, shocking news broke out.\nA new Pope had been selected, a glorious, yet somewhat oversized new Pope: Fettuccine Alfredo Cannoli, the Big Boy himself!\nNow, one might ask, \u201cNaiar, how is it possible for an infamous criminal to become the Pope?\u201d See, the minimum requirement to become the Pope is being a male Catholic. Cannoli simply \u201cconvinced\u201d the College of Cardinals using \u201ccreative arguments\u201d that he, and only he, was the best choice for Pope. \nNow that Cannoli is protected by the Church, not only is he safe from the authorities, but also is safe from rival factions within the church due to a shake up of senior church officials.  A highly trusted source tells The Radish, \u201cHe\u2019s confessed his sins and washed them away with holy water. He\u2019s a new man.\u201d  Despite this, in addition to naming convicted mobsters Colin Pisani and Francesco Onofrio as Cardinals, he has also declared several of his former associates saints for miracles such as \u201cgetting Tony to pay up\u201d and \u201cspringing me out of the slammer.\u201d \nFrom now on, Mr. Cannoli can only be addressed as His Holiness, Pope Big Boy.\n*Big Boy receives a 5% off frequent offender card\n",

    "title": "Proposed Zoom Additions: For Students By Students",
    "authors": ["jacob-schles"],
    "issue": "february-2021",
    "content": "Almost a year since the pandemic has started, ever-present Zoom meetings have barely changed. They have the same boring sans serif font, same clunky interface, same host (bourgeoisie) and non-host (proletariat) dynamic. Nothing is new. \nIn this time of staying inside and mindless, repetitive week-to-week routines, Zoom must change. Listed below are proposed additions to Zoom for a more fun and exciting class.\n1. New era, new font\n    Times have become incredibly chaotic. We need a font to reflect that. Wingdings is the perfect font! With its confusing nature, wingdings class could become a staple in all elementary schools. Just imagine the excitement this would bring to a normally boring and frankly useless \u264b\ufe0e\u25fb\ufe0e \u274d\ufe0e\u264b\ufe0e\u264d\ufe0e\u2752\ufe0e\u25a1\ufe0e\u264f\ufe0e\u264d\ufe0e\u25a1\ufe0e\u25a0\ufe0e\u25a1\ufe0e\u274d\ufe0e\u2653\ufe0e\u264d\ufe0e\u2b27\ufe0e class which, let's be honest, isn\u2019t even a real subject.\n2. Russian roulette style host privileges\n     Every ten minutes, a new host will randomly be selected. Just think: you\u2019re suddenly kicked out of class and when you return, Brayden has muted everyone and is making a sandwich in his underwear. What a dream! This new, exciting addition would have kids leaping out of their bed and then back into their bed to join class.\n3. Less functional servers\n     Glitches, lags, and poor connection are all a part of your favorite classes. We propose that Zoom purchase cheaper servers to make all classes just a little bit more chaotic. The quality of Zoom\u2019s servers should be like the quality of our English classes during quarantine: nonexcistent.\n4. The Zoom Wand\u2122\n     The Zoom Wand\u2122 would be a special button to make class a bit more interesting. Do we know what it would do? No. But you have an imagination. Come up with something.\n5. The Zoom Olympics\n      Who can disconnect the fastest? Who can spam the \u201cinvite host\u201d button the most? Who can annotate the best curse word onto the teacher's presentation? All these questions and more could be answered at the Zoom Olympics, held every 4 years. Or whenever the next pandemic is, whichever comes first.\nWe hope the Zoom team finds this and listens. Students across the world would see a vast difference in education. Will it be better? Probably not. But it\u2019ll be different!",

I\u2019ve been found by a hall monitor and marched into the auditorium. Strange how they have the resources to do that but not keep the mezzanine open.\n\nBut I have an IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT. It is now illegal to use the staircases at Brooklyn Tech without a pass. The punishment is 4 years of jail time or having all of your course credits revoked.\nHow does one acquire a stairs pass, you may be wondering. Well, it\u2019s quite simple. All you need is to put all of your personal information on a slip of paper and parade about the hallways of Tech wearing nothing but it. The deans will take you to an undisclosed location and tell you that you can have a stair pass if you never do that again, mentioning something about \u201cscarring the children\u201d and \u201cdisturbing the peace.\u201d\n\nIf you follow these steps to the letter, you can use the stairs to your heart\u2019s content.\n\nOf course, we should discuss how to get to other floors without the pass. There are several methods, such as climbing the scaffolding, phasing through the floors, bribing the stair guards with mulberry pies, or prank calling a hospital and having an ambulance run over anyone in the way of your sweet, stair-climbing goodness.\n\nThat\u2019s all from me!

Basically, I know you\u2019re busy being governor and all, but imma need you to do me a solid. You know this vaccine thing you\u2019ve been rolling out? Drop it.\nMy life has been so much better since Ms. Rona came to town. My commute used to be 45 minutes of listening to a guy shouting about the end of the world, but now I just have to deal with 45 seconds of hearing my dad shout at his subordinates about the end of their jobs. And I can eat my lunch dino nuggies fresh from the oven. I don\u2019t even have to share! I used to get a crick in my neck after my third period nap, but now that they\u2019re from the comfort of my own bed, I wake up refreshed and ready for my 4th period instagram meme sesh.\n\nBesides, moving my after-school activities online means one less teen pregnancy this year.\u00a0\n\nOh, and the bathroom. Don\u2019t even get me started on the bathroom. Not only does the door close every time\u2014it locks. There\u2019s no one vaping or filming tiktoks. So, when I remember to mute myself, there is no mic picking up the plop of that dino nuggie deuce. Seriously guys, the bathroom is for taking care of business, not renegading.\nBesides, it\u2019s kinda too late for me to go back to school. One look at me and the gym teacher will know I've been lying on my workout logs. I also don\u2019t think I can take a test without Quizlet open anymore, or answer a question without Google. And people will realize my Zoom icon isn\u2019t really me.\nSo, thanks in advance, gov. This will really make my life a lot better. I wish we could stay and chat more about some ideas I have regarding the legal drinking age, but right now I\u2019ve got to go and call my grandma to break the news.",

    "content": "This just in: Three dead, seventeen injured, thousands extremely confused, and five mildly confused as the rampage across the city increases in intensity. The Kool-Aid man, America\u2019s national treasure, has lost it. After being sued by the Association Against Comically Large Containers (AACLC), the messy divorce, and the weirdly specific taxes on jugs with liquids in them, he just couldn\u2019t afford to pay up. He was left with two options: sell his Kool-Aid to the 2020 Kool Blood Drive or run.\n\nSo who can we blame for this? Sources say, \u201cBLAME HIM HE RIPPED OFF MY LEG AND THREW IT IN HIS JAR\u201d and \u201cWHERE\u2019S MY LIVER?\u201d But we\u2019re still looking into it.

This isn\u2019t an \u2018OH YEAH\u2019 moment.\u201d\n\u201cYou wanna try that again? Maybe give us back an organ or two?\u201d\n\u201cOH NOOOOOOO.\u201d\nThis just in: Our anchor, Gus Essofa, has been swallowed alive. Who could\u2019ve seen this coming, am I right, Gus?\n\\[Screaming and drowning in Kool-Aid noises] \u201cShould we try speaking to his wife and ki\u2014oh my god. Oh my god, oh my god, holy Jesus.\u201d\nThis just in: His wife and children have been cracked open and are being slurped up by the family dog. This is, arguably, not very good.\n\n\u201cCan they press charges on a dog, Martin? Because mine won\u2019t stop eating my shoes, and honestly I\u2019ve had eno\u2014oh, my mic is still on?\u201d\nSorry about that.\nSo where is Mr. Aid Man going? This dangerous behemoth seems to stop for no one and nothing. Locals are taking matters into their own hands. A local cheesecake-hater and lifelong fun-loather, Dave Wonderbread has been doing his best to redirect the liquedous giant towards his local Cheesecake Factory with rope and emotional manipulation.\n\u00a0\u201cMaybe your wife would\u2019ve stayed if you hadn\u2019t gone to that Cheesecake Factory on seventeenth street!\u201d Dave shouts as he weakly attempts to toss a rope around the Kool-Aid man\u2019s leg, failing miserably. Another local, Cheryl Ottmeal, a health-food-obsessed woman from Colorado, flew to the scene with her twenty-seven weapons of mass destruction to deal with the sugary beast.\n\n\u201cThis is for your low vitamin A content!\u201d She screams as she launches a chemical warfare attack that violates several clauses of the Geneva Convention.\nThat's all the news we have as of now. As Mr. Aid Man gets closer to our headquarters in the basement of the Applebee\u2019s between 24th and 25th street (the one with the broken light so it reads \u201cA p ebee\u2019s\u201d), we fear that our very existence is in danger.

    "title": "Tech's Vending Machines Stop Time",
    "authors": ["ilana-rahim-braden"],
    "issue": "november-2021",
    "content": "After performing careful observations on the behaviours of various vending machines in Brooklyn Tech, our extremely qualified team has concluded that there is a high probability of time-stopping fields appearing sporadically around snacks just as you purchase them, specifically in vending machines. The abnormalities seem to be attracted to the vending machines themselves, rather than the desire for a snack, as some previously suggested.\u00a0\n\nBefore our study, many students falsely assumed that they were just encountering bad luck as their bag of chips snagged on the vending machine\u2019s coils or the vending machine \u201cate\u201d their coins. But we now have proof otherwise.\u00a0\n\nUpon closer inspection, snacks trapped in the vending machine are suspended in midair. Our researcher described the phenomenon:\u00a0 \u201cThe snacks seem to be getting stuck in a continuous space-time stasis\u2014until these sporadic fields decide to release the snack into the hands of one lucky student.\u201d So, the fields are harmless enough, albeit annoying.\u00a0\n\nWhat you really need to look out for, however, is your money\u2014if you get it back, that is. Your money is shiny, noisy, crisp, and very tasty. And if it's not any of that, your money can buy you stuff. Why would a time field want to give it back? If you were a time field, wouldn\u2019t you think that you deserve to get your change? Of course you would. What kind of time field would you be if you didn\u2019t? Not a very good one that\u2019s for sure. So, how do you prevent the machine\u2019s most common trick? Well, be sure to check that a time field has not given you money from a future date. You will get accused of money forgery, receive -1000 social credits, and somehow land up in prison for 125 years\u2014a year for every cent the vending machine is annoyed to have a new time-stopping field to deal with.\u00a0\n\nAnother common vending machine money trick: just as you put in your coins, a time-stopping field may appear around it. The vending machine, not knowing how to deal with a coin that defies the laws of physics, will just spit it back out into the change bin. This may also occur when putting pennies in the vending machine.\n\nTherefore, we should really be nicer to the school\u2019s vending machines. They aren\u2019t junk, they are simply annoyed at having to deal with these incessant time-stopping fields.\u00a0\n\nDespite many repair efforts, the fields have yet to be quelled, and there is no clear solution in sight. However, these small quirks just make the vending machines of Tech all the more iconic and lovable. Maybe next time you see a vending machine, you should try giving it a snack back. <3",

This is in no small part thanks to the mysterious departure of two former members, \u201cCurious\u201d George Harrison, and John \u201cVladimir\u201d Lennon. It\u2019s been said that John left because of throat issues, apparent from his last few performances, where his voice is obviously shot.

Unfortunately for him, an anonymous survey of Beatles fans rendered it impossible for us to put him in anywhere but last place. An unfortunate thing, as his drumming skills are matched only by his fashion sense, as both are at the level of a middle schooler. </p>\n<p>Famous for his characteristic sunglasses and side whiskers, Ringus Stringus Bingus has been a fan unfavorite for years and is evidently an immortal, soulless vampire. His beady black eyes, young appearance, black clothes, and inability to look directly at the sun make it quite clear that he has been turned. If on any occasion you see this man, run. Run before it\u2019s too late. You value your blood, don\u2019t you? RUN!</p>\n<li><p>Paul Cart Mall Cop</p>\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Ss6dvBd6n6a18lxzoLOMhTy2Y7RFQwl_5nV0GdwlZCDDPylyG1pQJlzGMmGtww1f59X1SXYhptADwh032MEog2HxSuwkaWhCUCU62N3IfgL73NFhbljr5gcjuGRcq6FfNjRAtxxh=s0)\n<p>Bassist and hypothesized vocalist of the Bee Gees, Paul tops our list at number one. Of the two surviving members, Paul is definitely one of them!</p>\n<p>His long, storied career ended abruptly in 2005 when he retired from music to pursue part-time mall security. This led to two high-budget documentary films based on his goofy mall antics, where he was depicted by Oscar-winning actor Kevin James.\n\nPolly McColly will definitely go down in history as one of the musicians of all time! With the holiday season coming around, be sure to give a listen to his legendary single, \u201cSimply Having a Wonderful Non-Denominational Winter Holiday Time.\u201d</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\nWe hope you enjoyed our list of the top two living Beatles!

    "content": "Any tech student familiar with Brooklyn Tech\u2019s current events has already heard about the principal\u2019s recent decision to replace the Tech Engineer with a new, much more fitting mascot designed by students, for students. Following weeks of closed-door meetings and passionate debate heard throughout the school from the basement courtroom, several mascot candidates have been chosen.\n\nFirst we have The Brooklyn Tech Salt Goon, designed and brought to life by student artists and biologists in an unlikely and unlikable collaboration. He\u2019s a seven foot tall, green, vomit-colored goblin man with white pustules all over his greasy body. He leaves a sticky, mustard-colored trail wherever he goes, which students have already dubbed \u201cThe Yellow Stick Road.\u201d He boasts a friendly attitude with a knack for stealing things like small objects on teacher\u2019s desks and massive, oozing sums of money from their pensions. This is reportedly the finance major\u2019s favorite candidate, calling him \u201ccute and relatable.\u201d\n\nThe school administration also tried to submit its own mascot candidate, the SGO Sticker. Made of recycled gym outfits, no corners were left uncut with the design of this mascot. This candidate would go around at school sporting events telling audience members that it absolutely needs twenty five dollars from each of them, only to run into the middle of the game and swallow every dollar bill whole. The first prototype went missing after a nearby private high school stole it after having previously called it \u201ca genius blend of education and business.\u201d Unfortunately, the final prototype was not built before the deadline for submissions; the only reminder was a misspelled email at 2 a.m. the night of.\n\nAnother submission was the Tech Echidna. This lovable, egg-laying mammal is a lot like tech students themselves. Much like most students, it secretes milk from its skin, giving it a warm, familiar feeling for students of every grade. The Tech Echidna would do signature dances, like its egg laying ritual. And, excitedly, it would start every basketball game by squeezing the ball out of its costume and then giving everyone a refreshing cup of its skin milk. Other relatable features like sharp spines and small neocortices will have students chanting \u201cTachyglossus aculeatus!\u201d after every home run.\n\nBut students from every corner of this godforsaken school have come together to propose one mascot above all others. Unnamed Principal, champion of students and slayer of questions at Snacks with the PrincipalTM. The Tech Principal would be an inflatable, slightly larger-than-life sized doll with wheels for feet and a turbo booster in the back for quick access to students in need. The Tech Principal has been addressed by critics as a \u201ccult-like symbol\u201d and \u201cnearing on dictatorial,\u201d however these critics have been dealt with by use of The Tech Principal\u2019s rear turbo booster.\n\nLet\u2019s face it. The Tech Engineer is a stupid mascot. What even is engineering? Can anyone in this school even put batteries in a dead calculator? The answer is no, and that\u2019s a good thing. We don\u2019t want our mascot making us look like nerds, do we? We want a powerful, new, and exciting mascot that will bring school pride and possibly fear. We hope the Board Dedicated to Selecting Mascots at Tech will make smart decisions, such as, and limited to, choosing the Salt Goon.",

One Junior simply shook her head and said, \"But how am I going to exfoliate now?\" Upon hearing the news, a freshman worriedly asked which floor the 8th-floor gym is on.

    "content": "In a recent interview, Brooklyn Tech administrators revealed that the school would soon be adopting new socialist policies that will, \u201cwipe clean the stain left by the bourgeois from this noble institution,\u201d beginning in the fall of 2019. The new policy, originating directly from the People\u2019s Commissariat of Education itself, states, \u201cGrades will all be added together and dispersed equally to all students to avoid inequality in any form.\u201d Essentially, any form of grade tracking would be averaged and spread amongst students equally in the name of Mother Russia.\n\nMany are curious as to how college admissions would work if everyone had the exact same GPA. When asked about this, another administrator said: \u201cAs long as all kids are equal and have no reason to feel that another student is doing better, then all is well in my book.\u201d From this statement, most have concluded that this new policy is less about practical equality and more about hurt feelings.\n\n\u201cUh, no it\u2019s all about making sure everyone feels equal,\u201d an administrator stuttered when asked about the policy. Apparently, they understood that the school using that very policy ruined all incentive and made it so nobody had to do any work, but all was well in the name of total educational equality.\n\nThe SGO has pledged their undying support for this new policy and is now even selling pins featuring everyone\u2019s favorite communist heroes in the SGO store, including but not limited to, Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky, Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili, Radimir Rutin, and Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s Birthmark. For those wondering, the pins cost $50 and only cost ~50 cents to make. 3% of the profits will go to the Comintern and will help socialism prosper in all the places that it has been established in.\n\nVenezuelan leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, when questioned said that he was \u201cexcited\u201d about the new changes, and is likely to \u201chost a glorious military parade for school\u201d sometime in June. The Brooklyn Tech Parent Association is eager for the Maduro\u2019s visit and is planning on holding a banquet in his honor.\n\nAn anonymous FBI official claims that the school will be raided immediately after he visits and that \u201cthere will be casualties, likely in the hundreds, maybe in the thousands, and possibly in the millions.\u201d In response the school has said that \u201cthe FBI has no right to invade a burgeoning beacon of socialism,\u201d and that \u201cany direct attack on BTHS soil will lead to immediate nuclear retaliation.\u201d\n\nOnce all is said and done, it\u2019s likely Brooklyn Tech is projected by many to go from the largest high school in America to either America\u2019s largest bread line or pile of smoldering ruins, as the FBI is ever so pushy with their continuous threats of a raid. Hopefully, this policy will fade away and BTHS will finally break up into the 19 individual schools it should have always been.",

    "content": "Mass student outrage occurred this morning as it was revealed through an anonymous Instagram post that Tech's beloved Fish Fishington was a complete and utter fraud.\n\nFish gained fame amongst his peers through a series of inspirational videos posted by his Pre Calc teacher, with captions such as \u201cnever let being a fish stop you from acing your Pre Calc test\u201d and \u201cwhen you fail your Pre Calc test, maybe you\u2019re a fish and jumping through hoops is more your thing. That\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nThe comments, now turned off, were filled with people offering their love and admiration for Fish and his hoop-jumping skills and inspiring story:\n\nLORRY: \u201cI mean, a fish trying to do Pre Calc? Bless his heart for trying, but honestly, what was he expecting? He\u2019s a fish! He can\u2019t write!\u201d\n\nNot only was Fish not technically enrolled in BTHS, but theories abound that this iteration of Fish wasn\u2019t even the first one, one comment thread explored:\nHANNAH: \u201cHe went from blue to green to pink. I mean I get body paint but that's weird, right? Nobody else seemed to think it was weird.\u201d\n\nRAWLF: \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t think the body paint thing was weird. I did think it was kinda weird that he wore a hat and suit to school. A little formal for school, and I mean I can't even get away with wearing hats in school. What, because he's small he can get away with it? Is it even a he, aren't there like three of them?\u201d\nHANNAH: \u201cHonestly we\u2019re not sure what number of fish we\u2019re on.\u201d\nRAWLF: \u201cThat\u2019s so sad. Man. That\u2019s awful.\u201d\nIn wake of this controversy, Mr. Lourn, the now-infamous Pre Calc teacher has released a statement to respond to the issue.\n\nIn his statement, Mr. Lourn did say how he tried to help Fishington. \u201cI mean, ever since I started giving him hoops to jump through instead of tests to take, his grades have increased significantly.\u201d\nHe continues, \"I mean, I did eventually realize Fishington was a fish. I'm not stupid. I'm not. Listen, lately my attention has been split between my work and home life; I mean I've really been putting myself out there with my fish tank decorating business. Wait right here I've got some in my car I'll be right back.\"\n\nHe has yet to come back.",

    "content": "Dear students,\n<br />\nWe\u2019ve noticed complaints of heatstroke, walking from the basement to the sixth floor, etc. So, out of concern for our dear students, we\u2019ve decided to replace gym and lunch with fun trips to the beach. You\u2019re welcome. However, to make this dream a reality, we need your help. \nFor funding, we\u2019ll need busloads of ignorant tourists willing to buy pretty, shiny, worthless things. See, money doesn\u2019t grow on trees, but it sure does grow in the ocean. What with seashells, jellyfish, plastic bottles, and the occasional small child, the ocean is a money farm\u2014all that could be sold for a tremendous mark-up! So, while you\u2019re there, don\u2019t think of it as digging through trash. It\u2019s a fun scavenger hunt. If you\u2019re lucky, you might just find something worth more than 5 cents! Additional activities will include: a competition for who can scam the most tourists I mean... raise the most money, a pickpocketing tournament, and extensive test prep for the 200 question beach exam.\nTo make time for this exciting enriched learning experience opportunity, it will count for both your lunch and gym periods! We will implement modified schedules to accommodate for the hours you\u2019ll toil I mean... enjoy yourselves at the beach! \nFor safety reasons, some gym teachers, teachers, and custodians will be posted in a network of strategically located, fortified checkpoints to quash all hopes of escape or revolt. \nDue to the large quantity of food left on the beach, delicious & nutritious buckets of sand will count as \u201csandwiches\u201d for students\u2019 lunch. However, it should be noted that any non-sand-based food you provide will be confiscated on sight and then sold to the highest bidder. For drinking water: We highly suggest unfiltered ocean water; it\u2019s held to a comparable standard to the school\u2019s water. You could also bring your own\u2014or better yet, buy bottled school water from us! But some salt really does add flavor, and pairs especially well with our premium sand buckets.\nDon\u2019t think this is below school administration, though. Some things are, but this is not one of those things. We\u2019ll be hard at work right beside students, selling all the washed up bottle caps, shells, and industrial waste you gather as mementos to the (aforementioned) clueless tourists. And don\u2019t worry; there\u2019s no need to remind us. We know how fantastic, generous, and humble we teachers are.\nNow you\u2019re surely thinking, \u201cNow, administrator The Radish is forbidden to name, this has to be completely illegal!\u201d But never fear: this wonderful new opportunity is part of an all-new mandatory SGO program which will help students pay for all $250 of your new and improved SGO sticker. Now, if you\u2019ve already paid for a sticker, don\u2019t worry; you\u2019ll still get a chance to contribute to the school\u2014with a whopping 5 dollars taken off the new sticker\u2019s price.\nOn another note, we\u2019ll be introducing questionable sushi Tuesdays, made from only the freshest of the beach\u2019s washed up fish! Again: this is to inform you that all students must purchase either an improved $250 SGO sticker, or the 2 years\u2019 labor variation for a Brooklyn Technical High School-sponsored diploma. Email us if you want your $5 off for already buying a sticker.\n<br />\nYours Truly, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\n*Important note: Please note that as you signed the permission slip, you can\u2019t pin anything on us, and have you forfeited your right to press charges against the school in court. And we have better lawyers than you.*\n",

    "issue": "february-2022",
    "content": "As a group of old \u201cclimate\u201d scientists warm their hands with car exhaust, they discuss a new phenomenon: climate change. The three have trudged through hours of acid rain to get here.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d says one, confused. This is Albert, the youngest one on the team at the chipper age of 58. He is sometimes na\u00efve but is mostly just plain dumb. \u201cI thought we agreed we could just ignore that forever,\u201d he continues, stupidly.\n\n\u201cWhat is this \u2018climate change\u2019 thingamajig you speak of?\u201d Pipes up Garrison. Garrison is the shortest one on the team and uses the word \u2018thingamajig\u2019 in hopes that his weird vocabulary will distract from the fact that he is vertically challenged.\n\u201cIt simply doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d shrugs Garrett, who sometimes gets confused with Albert except he\u2019s not stupid and is actually very woke. \u201cFor example, the other day it was 85\u00b0 and sunny\u2013\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s February,\u201d cut in Albert, stupidly. This stupid, stupid statement earns Albert a slap on the cheek. Garrett\u2019s hand is warm on his face (because of climate change), and smells of car exhaust mixed with hints of ozone? Albert flinches and asks, \u201cHave you been eating ozone again?\u201d Garrett has a seizure from his intense repulsion at the accusation as Garrison watches from afar, amused.\nWhen Garrett becomes comprehensible again, he immediately threatens to call pest control on Albert for being \u201ctoo much like a cockroach.\u201d\n\nGarrison attempts to leave; the toxic energy is contributing to his large, shiny bald spot. But the smog is too thick to see through for him to leave (unlike his hair). As chaos and water levels rise, Albert shouts at Garrett, \u201cCLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL, YOU SMALL IMBECILE!\u201d\nGarrison's face lights up, thingamajigs are getting exciting, but he says nothing as Garrett looks at him, registering all 4 feet and 7 inches of Garrison's tiny existence before the water level rises too high and his short \u201cfriend\u201d is engulfed in the chocolate-milk-colored liquid. \u201cI told you we should\u2019ve met in a taller building,\u201d says Garrett, face-palming because he\u2019s young at heart.\n\u201cNo! You should have realized when we visited Yosemite that there are supposed to be trees in National Parks!\u201d Albert\u2019s lungs are burning but he continues. \u201cYou should have realized that icebergs are supposed to be bigger than 6 feet by 9 feet, and that the sky is supposed to be blue! It\u2019s not supposed to be dark all day, Garret.\u201d\n\nAlbert\u2019s lungs collapsed shortly after this from ESI (excessive smog inhalation) and he slipped into the milky water. To this day, Garrett still believes his death was because of that nasty smoking habit of his.\n\nGarrison\u2019s body was never found. Researchers concluded that it was his lack of mass combined with the fact that Garrett ate the ozone layer that caused his body to float off the Earth and into the cosmos. Garrett agreed though he never really believed in climate change, anyway.\n\nGarrett was later found to have died of ignorance. No one attended his funeral.\nSo, what did we learn from this insightful meeting? Be a Garrett or be an Albert, and you\u2019ll die anyways!",

Read these testimonials and decide if you are eligible for a pair of knee patches and up to $3 million in financial compensation.* \n> There I was, running away from the cops, having just committed some relatively unspeakable crimes, but even I didn\u2019t deserve the misfortune that was about to befall me. All of a sudden, my legs give in, and as soon as I hit the ground my little, uncovered knees get horrendously scraped up by the rough asphalt of an Arby's parking lot. There\u2019s a decent chance they\u2019re infected now, not to mention the danger of the alcohol swab the cops put on me. Had I not been wearing ripped jeans I would have gotten away scot-free. (Jerry, an 8-year-old from Florida)\n> It started off as some playful kiddin\u2019 around with my girlfriend. Just some light punching, ramming each other into cars, knocking some toddlers over. But then she shoved me. My world was shattered along with my foundation of trust as I lay sprawled on the ground. My little knees bled, and bled, and bled as she walked away without me. Damn you, ripped jeans! (Sam, a 64-year-old from Oregon)\n> It was just like any other evening, I was climbing under the turnstile like a rad individual when I felt a burn in the mid-leg area. My vision blurred from the pain as I looked down to see the skin scraped from my knee. It was sickening. I crawled to the train platform, and as I pushed myself down those stairs, my ripped jeans exposed my wound. Luckily enough, I found someone\u2019s crutches to steal, but I must remember that not everyone is as fortunate. (Hubert, a 19-year-old from Queens)\n> I was sliding across the floor on my knees in one of those epic victory dances that one does when they deem appropriate when I noticed a trail of blood behind me. It wasn\u2019t mine, it was the blood of the people I had barreled through. But my poor weak knees burned for a few days after that. (Chadley, a 21-year-old from Coolsville)\n> No lie, since putting these on, I\u2019ve heard thirty-seven times, \u201cWhat happened to your little knees? Aren\u2019t they cold? Were they half-off? Did a wolf mug you? Did you lose your job and need to sell part of your jeans?\u201d (Brenda, a 26-year-old from a Nondescript Department Store)",

    "content": "This Wednesday, \\[name redacted] of Brooklyn Technical High School (BTHS) has passed away due to a severe allergic reaction. According to classmates, they drank water from an 8th floor gym fountain that morning, a fatal mistake.\n\nIn an email from the student's parents, they told us:\n> Their reaction was so fast. By the time we knew what happened, \\[name redacted] was already dead \u2026 This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen today. I mean, \\[name redacted] wasn\u2019t allergic to water. And, we\u2019re pretty sure the reaction wasn\u2019t from an arsenic or lead deficiency; we make sure to keep those nutritional staples in our everyday diet. As far as we know, \\[name redacted] was totally healthy, and we couldn\u2019t be more heartbroken. We\u2019re just left wondering why \\[name redacted] had to die today. Tomorrow would have been so much more convenient\nOf course, we all know their death was inevitable, as is with all mortals, but it is definitely unfortunate for it to have happened this way. It's just sweet to know that the BTHS community has been hurt knowing the water fountains have killed. As one student described, \u201cthe water fountains of our school form a community in ways school doesn\u2019t. Over time, we all agreed to avoid them, but that wasn\u2019t about \\[anonymous student\u2019s] allergy. Why would it be? That was about the community of avoiding water fountains.\u201d\n\nOne investigator thought that this makes sense in context, responding \u201cavoiding a certain food or drink can make you more sensitive to its effects,\u201d when asked about the unusual water fountain student agreement.\u00a0\n\nPossibly to discover those effects, user \u201cbeefsoupismeattea\u201d wrote \u201cI heard \u2026 water samples were being transferred to a physics lab in Nevada,\u201d on a reputable, anonymous public messaging site in response to a news video also covering this story.\u00a0\n\nIn a statement addressing this incident, BTHS said, \u201cWe are aware of what happened and send our condolences to the family.\u201d Even though they do not say what happened in the email, they also stated: \u201cwhile investigations are going on, we suggest not drinking water at school.\u201d When questioned, nobody seemed concerned. As one student elaborated, \u201cwe\u2019ll just adapt to have leathery skin, like in Dune.\u201d Although this has no medical basis, user \u201cbeefsoupismeattea\u201d mentioned something similar.\n\nSome teachers had very little empathy for anyone involved, the dead student nor the ones left. Even after we were done with the interview, we could hear the teacher quietly muttering: \u201cI drink water, too. I wish that it didn\u2019t have to be this way with that kid, but we\u2019ll have to move on. We have to keep learning, and growing as individuals, even if they can\u2019t.\u201d The teacher then proceeded to plug their psychology book, explaining this was just their coping mechanism to themself. While this may be considered concerning, \\[name redacted] is dead.\nIt is so very unfortunate that \\[name redacted] of BTHS has died from an allergic reaction to the school water. Even though we have always thought there could be something in the water, it seems that the problem was the water itself all along.",

You win. You choose the wrong door and three smooth-faced men grab you and drag you by your ankles as the camera closely follows. The last thing your family will ever see of you will be your terrified face on the TV screen.\n\nAn anonymous network exec issued the following statement in regards to the outrage:\n\u201cI thought it would be funny.\u201d\nWell according to Twitter, it wasn\u2019t.\n\nWe caught up with one of the judges, Lauralyn Ashly, as she was \u201cvibin'\u201d (vibrating?) outside of a local fire station.

    "issue": "april-2021",
    "content": "Dear IKEA,\nI love you, I really do. I've bought all my furniture from you. I only eat your food. I always go on an annual pilgrimage to Sm\u00e5land. I've even petitioned for New York to move to Sweden. Perhaps, with enough helicopters, we could do it! I just haven't heard about any follow-ups. Perhaps they're busy with other unimportant matters like \"homelessness\" and \"coronavirus\"\u2014but we could solve all that by being Swedish!\n\nThe last time I was in Sweden, I became one with the land. I revoked all material possessions, lay down on the ground of IKEA, and let the cold floor take me. The holy act seemed incredibly popular and I gathered a crowd, which even even lifted me up and escorted me out! I will never forget that marvelous day.\n\nEach day I find myself awakening on my soft and cozy Ut\u00e5ker, which only cost me $149. For breakfast, I make sure to eat the highest-quality IKEA Lingonberry Jam with some amazing IKEA Coffee. I then take a walk to IKEA, and I try to get a job there. For some reason, they always kick me out for \"several reports of you disturbing the peace in several IKEAs\" and \"attempting to live \\[in IKEA],\" but I'm not too sure what that's about. Perhaps I just need to devote more of my life to IKEA. Maybe then the holiness of IKEA will accept me.\n\nAfter trying about 7 to 912 IKEAs, I eat lunch in one of them. I make sure to eat everything, so I can absorb the pure essence of all IKEA food at once.\n\nUpon arriving home, styled after various IKEA showrooms, I spend the rest of my day worshiping my IKEA shrine in the shower.\n\nI do not eat dinner, for I must only take in the energy of IKEA during this time and devote myself to them. I then sleep, excited to repeat the routine the next day.\n\nMost people question my routine, saying things like \"Where do you get money?\" or \"Why are you like this?\" or \"Sir, is that a stolen bag full of IKEA chair parts?\" But to me, the real question is: \"Why aren't you doing as I do?\"\nNow, despite my love for you, IKEA, there's just one issue. Where is the exit? No, seriously, ever since I've entered this last IKEA, I've been stuck here. Now, thankfully, due to the IKEA family membership, I'm able to send this letter out. But would you like to know what else should be sent out? Me. I want to get out. It's been about 6 or 20 days since I've entered. I've had to raid the kitchen for some food, and, frankly, I'm getting tired of the food here. Holiness and beauty can only exist with evil and ugliness present. Being stuck in heaven is making me tired of it.\nBesides the lack of doors, what's up with everything else about the layout here? It\u2019s all so non-euclidean. I find myself entering doors that don't exist, going straight in curved pathways, or climbing up the stairs to a lower floor.\n\nThe people in this IKEA don't feel right, too. They are too friendly. All want to help me. Whatever happened to the guy who would curse at you because your cart was too close to theirs? Or the cashier that was just done with it?\n\nI want to go back. Please, IKEA, I miss my old life. I miss my- nothing. I miss nothing. I have nothing but IKEA.\nI am one with IKEA now. I am IKEA. IKEA is me.",

    "title": "Grocery Store (No Milk): A Memoir",
    "authors": ["naiar-islam"],
    "issue": "may-2021",
    "content": "Nothing lasts forever. I\u2019m learning that the hard way. I\u2019ve poured so much out just to learn it was all for nothing. There\u2019s no milk for the bowl of cereal I already made. Nothing lasts forever. Not even milk. I know what I must do now. I have to go to the grocery store.\nWarmth doesn\u2019t exist in the grocery store. The cold, cold air hits my face as I walk in. The harsh fluorescent lights illuminate my harsher reality: no more milk.\nSo I walk to the milk aisle. I walk, and I walk, and I walk. Since when was this grocery store so big? Since when was I so small? It took an eternity but I finally made it. It\u2019s even colder here. I shiver as I pick up a gallon of milk. Wow, this was heavier than I thought it would be. It\u2019s dragging me down. I almost crumble under the weight. But I persevere because there\u2019s nothing worse than having no milk. My mother always used to say, \u201csometimes the milk will be heavy, but you just have to carry it anyway.\u201d Mom, you were right. I\u2019m so sorry.\nI have to get in line now. I must walk again. Walk, walk, walk, do we ever stop walking? I had to walk to the milk aisle and now I have to walk back. Life is just full of cycles, isn\u2019t it? We wake up, we go to sleep. We live, we die. We run out of milk and buy more just for it, only to run out again. What a funny little thing we humans do, life. But I\u2019m getting sidetracked. I have no milk. All that matters is getting milk.\nThe line is so long I can barely see the cashier from the end of it. After five minutes I think about how this could be hell, or purgatory at least. Maybe I\u2019m dead and I\u2019m doomed to wait in this line for eternity. But eventually I made it to the front of the line. My mother had a phrase for that, too: \u201cThe line may be long, and you might think you\u2019re in hell, or purgatory at least, but eventually you\u2019ll get to the cashier.\u201d Thanks, mom, for the oddly specific advice.\n\nThe cashier seemed kind. I think she liked me. She was a beacon of real light, and not the fluorescent grocery store kind. She was the only warmth in this store. I\u2019ve only looked into her eyes once, but I feel as if I\u2019ve known her my whole life. I wouldn\u2019t say it was love at first sight, but I knew I could love her if I tried. My mother had a phrase for this as well. \u201cSometimes running out of milk and going to the grocery store means almost falling in love with the cashier.\u201d How did she know? But I had no time to talk to the cashier. My cereal was still waiting to be milked.\n\nAt long last I have the milk. I\u2019ve finally achieved what I\u2019ve been working towards for the past twenty minutes or so of my life. It was a long journey, and I need to talk to my mom about some things, but at least I got the milk. I should be happy. And yet-\nNever mind that. I poured some milk into my cereal. But, about to eat it, I begin to doubt myself. What if the journey wasn\u2019t worth it? What if this milk isn\u2019t as good as I hoped it would be? Have I put milk on a pedestal? How much of me is me, and how much of me is milk? How did my mom predict everything? Is she a milky witch? On second thought, I don\u2019t really like milk that much. My cereal is probably stale by now anyways. I need to get my priorities straight. I want to talk to that cashier. I want to live a life.\nAnd so I go to the grocery store once more, but this time there\u2019s no milk on my mind.",

    "content": "Entry #1:\n* I saw this ad for the game called Merge Mansion. It looks terrible. I want to buy it.\n\n* I have decided to download it. It is interesting so far. The main purpose of the game is to merge two of the same objects together. It\u2019s simple, but very enjoyable. I don\u2019t know why.\n\nEntry #2:\n* I told my friends about this game. They looked at me like I was crazy.\n\n* I spent the entirety of 2nd period curled up in a ball in the corner of the mezzanine playing Merge Mansion. Sadie was with me. I think she had fun. I am not very sure.\n\n* Sadie told me that the first law of thermodynamics says that the more you merge, the closer your objects get to becoming black holes; they get really dense from all the stuff going into them. I missed a chance to make a \u201cyour mother\u201d joke there. All I could do was merge.\n\n* I was also told that there is a one in seven billion chance that if my hands touch one another that the atoms will interlock just so that they\u2019ll merge. I want to try it.\n\nEntry #3:\n* The more I get into this game, the more confusing it gets. Something\u2019s very suspicious about the grandma. I think she\u2019s D.B. Cooper, but I cannot be certain. She rakes a lot. I wonder what she\u2019s raking.\n\nEntry #4:\n* It\u2019s knives. Grandma is raking knives.\n\nEntry #5:\n* I\u2019ve started to find my own grandma to be more than a little suspicious, too. She has an ENTIRE drawer dedicated to cutlery. She has a whole drawer for knives. What does she need those knives for, to merge into a rake?? Preposterous.\n\n* I have realized that I know that knives merge into rakes off the top of my head. What\u2019s next? Knowing that rakes merge into shears, and shears merge into wheelbarrows, and wheelbarrows merge into saws, and saws merge into shovels, and shovels mer-\nEntry #6:\n* I have started to shove random objects together to see if they will merge. One day it will work. One day\u2026\nEntry #7:\n\n* I was late to school today. I stayed in bed and played Merge Mansion until I was out of energy. I couldn\u2019t get up. I was paralyzed.\n\n* During one of my free periods I hung out with my friends. One of them said the word \u201cemerging\u201d and I immediately started repeating \u201cMerge? Merge? Merge! Merge?\u201d I couldn\u2019t stop no matter how hard I tried. I was like one of the seagulls from the hit Disney movie \u201cFinding Nemo.\u201d I don\u2019t remember how that ended, I blacked out. I think this is starting to become an issue.\nEntry #8:\n* They say the first step to recovery is to admit you have a problem. I didn\u2019t do that. My first step was googling \u201cWhat to do when you are addicted to Merge Mansion.\u201d I couldn\u2019t find anything but addresses to rehab centers. Extremely unhelpful.\n\n* I then tried googling \u201cMMA,\u201d for \u201cMerge Mansions Anonymous.\u201d I found a bunch of sweaty homosexuals performing some sort of wrestling ritual. It was interesting, but not helpful for my situation. I bookmarked the page.\nEntry #9:\n* I finally told all of my friends about my issue. They laughed in my face. I should get new ones. Ginger ones. With green eyes. Ones that like to wear yellow shirts with white shirts underneath.\n\nEntry #10\n* I have realized that the dream friend I was describing was the main character Maddie, from Merge Mansion.\n\nEntry #11\n* I have made tremendous strides today. I have deleted Merge Mansion. I don\u2019t know what to do now.\n\nEntry #12\n* I tried to help my addiction by introducing myself to a new game: Candy Crush. It did not work. Nothing can ever replace the hole in my heart that Merge Mansion has left.\n\nEntry #13\n* Help.\n\n* I have no idea what to do with my life.\n* It has been 36 days since I have seen the light of day. Oh well. There\u2019s daylight in Merge Mansion.\n* I close my eyes and all I can think about is Merging.\n\n* \\*sigh\\*\n\n* Merge.\n\n* CRONCH.\nEntry #14\n* <span class=\"blacked-out\">A bunch of black bars</span>\n* <span class=\"blacked-out\">And</span>\u0e53\u0454\u0433\ufeee\u0454 <span class=\"blacked-out\">is</span>\n* <span class=\"blacked-out\">the one</span> m\u0338\u0315\u0352\u0310\u034a\u0322\u031d\u0319\u0319\u0327e\u0336\u0308\u031a\u0300\u033d\u030b\u030b\u030c\u0308\u035a\u0330\u033b\u0332\u0330\u0356r\u0335\u031b\u031b\u0301\u034c\u030f\u0305\u035d\u0347\u0329\u0356\u0325\u0326\u0323g\u0337\u0343\u0307\u0342\u0320\u0359\u0349\u0319e\u0335\u0303\u033d\u0314\u035d\u0302\u031b\u032f\u0317\u034d\u031f  <span class=\"blacked-out\">can see</span>\n\n* <span class=\"blacked-out\">(does this count as formatting)</span>\u3010m\u3011\u3010e\u3011\u3010r\u3011\u3010g\u3011\u3010e\u3011<span class=\"blacked-out\">ehehjdnhe</span>",

    "content": "The himbo: A longstanding trope on the high school scene. They eat, they sleep, and they tie their shoes one toe at a time. But, despite everyone\u2019s familiarity with a himbo, how much do people really know about them? Welcome to our himbo case study.\nWe began with an investigation. We looked around New York City to study himbos. We examined their glistening muscles, chiseled faces, and complete obliviousness that we were in a bush, ten feet away from them.\n\nOur investigation started with a himbo petting a golden retriever. Thanks to our psychology degrees, we were able to deduce that this himbo was empathizing and connecting with the dog\u2014heavily connecting. They seemed to share the same soul.\n\nThe second himbo we investigated was trying to ask the dog what it wanted for lunch, but to no avail.\n\nThe last himbo was with a child. It seemed that the child was performing a simple \u201ccoin behind the ear\u201d trick on the himbo. The himbo was rushed to the hospital after; they went insane from seeing the trick.\nWe then went farther into an urban environment to study himbos. We found one at a glasses store. Rather than selecting glasses at the store, he punched a window, shattered it, took two pieces of glass, and then walked out, screaming, \u201cI have new glasses!\u201d It was strange to say the least.\n\nAt this point, we thought we had all the evidence to present our case study. But we forgot something: the himbo in our midst.\nFor the second part of our study, Radish writers Science Scientifically and Smart VeryGood interviewed Radish Vice President, John Lesley, to figure out more about these remarkable people.\nSCIENTIFICALLY: So, here in the Radish, you\u2019re basically our very own himbo. What are your thoughts on your label?\nLESLEY: Woah, is that a tie? That\u2019s cool! You\u2019re wearing a tie! My dad said fancy people wear ties.\nVERYGOOD: Well, uhm, alright. John, do\u2014\nLESLEY: No. I don\u2019t pee. Next question.\nVERYGOOD: That wasn\u2019t the questi\u2014\nLESLEY: I\u2019m pretty hungry. You know, this one time I wanted to toast bread, so I could eat that cool \u201ctoast and butter\u201d thing I always see people eating in the movies, but I burned the kitchen down. I think I looked pretty cool in the fire, though! \\[Flexes and kisses his muscles.]\nSCIENTIFICALLY: Anyway, where do you sleep?\n\nLESLEY: My mom said I get a room of my own when I learn how to open doors, but with some string and a lever I think I will! It\u2019s psychics!\nVERYGOOD: Do you think you would be a good parent if you were to have a child?\nLESLEY: Speaking of kids, this one time a baby was crying, so I tried to find its volume button. It got louder when I hit an ear, so I tried hitting the other ear. Then the mom made me sad. She yelled at me. Then the baby started mocking me with little baby noises, which just made it all worse. Long story short, I\u2019m due to appear in court this Thursday.\nVERYGOOD: A-are you crying? Why are your eyes watery?\nLESLEY: I\u2019m really afraid to blink. Whenever I blink, I become blind for a little. What if I blink one day and never see again?\nSCIENTIFICALLY: You won\u2019t go bli\u2014\nLESLEY: Is that a squirrel? I wanna pet it!\nWith that, we conclude our himbo study. The himbo is a strange mystery the world seems unready to unravel. However, we hope that, someday, the world will be willing to accept them like a himbo to a squirrel.",

    "issue": "february-2020",
    "content": "When you think of Garfield, what comes to mind? The beloved orange tabby? Just a lasagna-loving cat, right? You fool. You utter buffoon. You have no knowledge of the universe and its truths. He is not a character but an entity\u2014one who is horrifyingly real. To fully comprehend the tale you're about to be told, we have to go back to the beginning. Or more accurately, before the beginning.\nDarkness. Silence. Nothingness. Then suddenly, a light. The light grows brighter and bigger until that's all there is. For millions of years, it stays like this. Until the light starts to dim and shrink. It takes the form of a cat. He has arrived. He created the beginning, and will bring the end. He was present at every major battle or disaster in human history. In ancient times, we honored and worshipped Him. Some say He is the inspiration for both God and the Devil.\nAs humanity grew and flourished, we forgot about Him. But Garfield was always there, influencing history from behind the scenes. Here's a short list of some of the major events Garfield is responsible for:\n- Killing the dinosaurs (because He was bored) \n- Kickstarting the French Revolution by inventing the guillotine \n- Killing Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria over a parking spot, triggering World War I \n- Stealing the Mona Lisa in 1911 \n- Stealing my heart \nThen, on June 19, 1978 there was a shift in the universe. A prophet had emerged. Jim Davis had terrible visions of a lasagna loving orange cat that will bring about the end of times. He decided to do something about it. Publishing the Garfield Comics (also known as the Post-Modern Dialects of Garf), he trapped Garfield in the realm of fiction. Not without sacrifice, however. \nTo keep Garfield at bay. Jim Davis had to dedicate his life to putting out Garfield content. He can't stop for too long, or else Garfield will grow too powerful and break back into our world. It's soul crushing work. He has to follow a certain set of rules and rituals to keep the barrier between our worlds working. These rituals were not disclosed to The Radish, however, it has been heavily implied that they are graphic in nature. \nNow you know the truth. The fate of the universe rests on Jim Davis' delicate shoulders. He and Garfield are constantly battling and will continue to do so until the end of time. You may ask, \"what do I do with this information?\" You should fear the answer. \n",

You\u2019ve heard your classmates whisper \u201coh no, they\u2019re going to collide!\u201d whenever you\u2019re assigned to a group together. You passed by their desk on a water break and saw that in their notes was a picture of you\u2014a well-drawn one at that. Next to it is a short poem about how cute your hair would look on a dog they saw. You were shocked. You almost let the water spill onto your shoes. You step out into the hallway and silently scream for half an hour.\n\nUpon returning, your teacher asks if a dean mistook you for a homeless person, and you calmly reply no. You can\u2019t stay calm, not after what just happened. You look to your classmates for guidance, but they are all eating their notebooks. You desperately wish to join them.\n\nThe next day before class, you are prepared. You made 11 different slideshows depending on their outfit. You will ask them why they were drawing you with hearts around your face. They enter. You flee out the window.\n\nSeveral months later after an agonizing recovery process (of which doctors call you \u201clucky to still be alive from\u201d) you hobble back to class, utterly defeated. Then you see them. They were waiting for you, they love you! Your hobbling grows to a breakneck pace\u2014which is to say, a pace that the doctors warned you could break your neck.\n\nThey stop you before you can come any closer. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in you,\u201d they say firmly.

Don\u2019t be so narcissistic.\u201d\nAll but your head is now a fine earthen-toned powder, full of small insects, and class is starting. You need to pull yourself together. Luckily, you have the answer that always works. \u201cWell,\u201d you say, breath quaking, \u201cI don\u2019t even need you anyway! I just wanted to be in a relationship with you for the money. I\u2019m a gold digger.\u201d\nThey sneer and walk away. They do not have money. That was a blatant lie.\nYou\u2019ll need a new love. And hey, that kid in your math class is always blushing when you make eye contact and not just always face a-flushed, right?",

    "issue": "november-2020",
    "content": "The chess community is celebrating! Chess developers have finally returned to update their game. For months, there were speculations that chess was finally going to receive an update after centuries of waiting. And now the developers have not only come with changes but also their reasoning behind their changes. If you are in any way interested in chess, or you want to see what the nerds in your English class have been screaming about, this is a must-read.\nChess 2.020 Patch Notes:\n- Removed the bishop.\n\n  - The bishop was overpowered in certain openings, such as the Scholar\u2019s Mate, the Beethoven\u2019s Ninth, and the Roll n\u2019 Tumble Down The Hill. It was abused by many players to get an unfair, easy win. We were unable to balance the bishop, so we removed it.\n- Added the eldritch horror.\n\n  - This piece now takes the place of the bishop. While it cannot capture pieces, the eldritch horror frightens the piece one tile in front of it. This paralyzes the piece for one turn.\n  - Use this piece with caution. Some of your opponent\u2019s pieces may be horror movie enthusiasts and therefore unaffected.\n- Weakened the king.\n\n  - We thought allowing the king to move on its own was inaccurate. Kings are usually filthy rich, and so they wouldn\u2019t travel by themselves. Nine pieces must surround the king as a convoy in order to move it.\n- New Cards:\n  - Seven of hearts.\n\n    - If you\u2019re a long time chess fan, you\u2019d know that the seven of hearts was removed in 1288 by the Real Council of Good Chess People (RCGCP) due to balancing issues. Now we\u2019ve brought it back!\n\n    - The seven of hearts can now delete one tile from the board, rather than one hundred.\n\n  - Blastoise, Porygon, and \\[copyright infringement from Nintendo].\n\n    - We\u2019re proud to present that Pokemon and chess are finally collaborating! This is what fans have been asking for since the beginning of Dr. Pokemon herself, so we\u2019re happy to give you what you have been begging for! These cards function the same way they would in a top-tier Belarusian Pokemon game, unless your opponent opens with a Roman set: then it\u2019s a Vietnamese game.\n  - \u201c+4\u201d cards.\n\n    - We know, you fans haven\u2019t been looking forward to this, and many of you despised the decision from our first announcement, but we know that this was a necessary addition to the game. And yes, you can stack \u201c+4\u201d cards on top of your opponent\u2019s \u201c+4\u201d cards.\n- Bug fixes:\n  - Fixed a bug where a pawn becomes another piece upon reaching the opposite end of the board.\n    - Fixed some texture issues. The game should now work in color mode.\n    - Fixed a bug where only your seventh grade science teacher is willing to play chess with you.\n\nWe hope that these fixes make chess more enjoyable.

    "content": "We here at The Radish asked our loyal viewers to anonymously submit their wildest Valentine\u2019s Day fantasies\u2014and boy did we get some spicy responses. So, Brooklyn Tech, here are your craziest fantasies.\n\n My fantasy is to meet two girls and go to a mud pit. Then, I would show them my pet pigs, Frank and Connie, and we\u2019d feed them. Frank and Connie will love to go wild, so we\u2019ll probably end up getting completely covered in dirt. Haha!\n\n I\u2019d like to be in bed with someone in a pure white silk outfit and a bowl of chocolate fudge. We\u2019d watch some TV and eat the fudge. I\u2019ve always wanted to do that but my mom says the fudge will ruin the white silk. This year, I\u2019m gonna be a naughty kid and eat the fudge with my friend anyway because it tastes so, so good.\n\n A fantasy? Well, I\u2019ve always wanted to be with someone in a Zelda costume. I\u2019d wear a Link costume\u2026 Basically, my goal is to live in the Legend of Zelda. I would get to meet Julius Caesar and Netflix would be free, but only for me. And\u2026 I\u2019d probably get pretty dirty running around in the fantasy?\n\nYou guys certainly know how to get dirty and fantasize! Though some of you need to get your heads out of the gutter!

    "content": "This pandemic has not been easy on the working people of America, those who struggle most economically. It was shocking when Congress passed a bill that actually helped. This bill, known to most as the stimulus bill, also sometimes called the stimulus dollar, included many details that aren\u2019t talked about much. \n\nRadish correspondents Jacob \u201cthe co-writer\u201d Schles and Charlotte \u201cthe co-writer\u201d Rotlander and Aramie \u201cthe co-writer\u201d Ewen and Maxime \u201cthe co-writer\u201d Ennis sought the truth. We are here to deliver it into your gaping, truth hungry mouths. You guys are so hungry for truth that it\u2019s hard to believe. So, so hungry.\n\nOur first discovery was on the bill\u2019s fifty-third page. A shopping list, including ice cream sandwiches, honey mustard, and socks, was shoved between the pages labelled \u201cSatanic cult location\u201d and \u201cPlans to buy (and eat?) Canada.\u201d However, we weren\u2019t too concerned about Satan or Canada. What could the list mean? To answer this question, we spoke to historian and grocery-store-frequenter John Saltine.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always told my husband to never trust a man who wears socks. Yes, I\u2019m constantly paranoid, and yes, my feet are always cold,\u201d he said. After this interview, we promptly left his foot-scented apartment. Good news for him: a recipe for mustard-stewed ice cream socks can be found on page fifty-eight of the bill.\n\nOnto our next discovery: page twelve, or, more precisely, where page twelve should have been. A ripped seam can be spotted between pages eleven and thirteen. What was on page twelve remains a mystery that only the bill authors  of the bill will ever know.\n\nQuick note for the bill authors: twelve is a number after eleven and before thirteen. This number is not to be confused with a fantasy pre-teen, known as a twElf. We understand the possible confusion that may have occurred while writing this bill.\n\nNot four but five greasy napkins with an interesting smell can be found on page twenty-six. Our labs have found that these greasy napkins are from none other than Ted Cruz\u2019s lunchbox, which usually has enough spoiled deli meats by the pound. Have you ever wondered what Ted Cruz\u2019s lunch smells like? We wish we didn\u2019t know. \n\nFinally, a tearjerker\u2014and not the greasy-napkin-stink kind of tear. Crossed out on page seventy-four is the proposed amendment to subsidize the career of School of Rock and iCarly star, Miranda Cosgrove. As soon as we saw, we emailed Ms. Cosgrove our condolences (in perfect grammar, may we add). She never replied, but we could feel the warmth in her heart all the way from her home in rural Kyiv in our offices in an abandoned Costco near our city\u2019s most famous McDonald\u2019s.\n\nThank you for reading through our findings. Seeking political knowledge and unwavering truth is hard, but you did it. Nice job! Now email your congressperson and demand justice for Miranda.\n",

    "content": "Where are chickens going? A chicken egg is a single chicken cell. Therefore a chicken cell is around 2 ounces. That\u2019s pretty big. A chicken should have many cells, so why do we see no huge chickens everywhere? Just four cells would be one magnificent, sloshy cup worth of body matter.\n\nNeeding to see this for myself, I decided to ask what we normally call a chicken where its tiny chicken mother is.\u00a0\n\nThe chicken said nothing. Fascinating.\nI got absolutely nothing out of that chicken. Believe me, I tried. I yelled at that chicken, didn\u2019t even get a squawk. A mysterious voice only told me, \u201cMiss, you need to leave the elementary school gym supply room.\u201d\n\u201cPut down the rubber chicken\u201d they chided me.\nWhat happened next was blurry, but I was taken to a small, cold room.\u00a0\n\nNothing. I heard nothing from that chicken. Maybe a little squeak, but was that a dream? I heard nothing. Nothing\u2026 could that be where the giant chickens are going?\nBut where is nothing? Space. Space has some nothing. There must be space in space for at least one giant chicken to grow.\n\nI blacked out, I saw stars. I wondered, have I joined the giant chickens? Looking down, I saw only my blurry, globular form.\n\nThat, in fact, is everything a chicken should be. Huge and looming, fuzzy and amorphous.\n\nI awoke in the detention center with a ringing in my ears. No squawking, but I had heard the truth.\nThey let me out and I saw the light of day.\nThen I saw a pigeon. A pigeon egg would be a pigeon cell, too\u2026 shouldn\u2019t all animals be larger?\nAt that moment I was truly, fully enlightened. Small Farma is lying to you. They want to sell smaller chickens; they can sell more chickens that way. Tinier chickens must be denser. They just want to get the little chicken into you.\n\nAnd then there are chicken nuggets. What else would chicken nuggets be for? They are using big chickens, too. They\u2019re using you. Don\u2019t let them get you.\nWhere are proper chickens going? They\u2019re going into you. We are all becoming the chickens.\n",

    "authors": ["ilana-rahim-braden"],
    "issue": "december-2021",
    "content": "When you feel Christmas cheer poisoning our clean and beautiful streets, beware the risks. The threat of holiday spirit looms over our spooky decorations, our festive meals, and our roses and teddy bears. Never do I celebrate a holiday without a fear of that dreadful combination of red, white, and green coming back to kill us all.\n\nI see the red, white, and blue of our American flag and I shake at the nauseating similarities I see of Xmas. I can\u2019t stand the bells of the clock tower, or the glows of LED lights without flashing back to the \u201caesthetics\u201d of Christmas. And don\u2019t even get me started on Santa. Every time I see him, I wonder why people even like this old guy.\n\nThat genius, ancient, crusty man likely has those eldritch monster slaves he calls \u201celves\u201d doing his bidding just to get the world in his clutches. This master of propaganda- his public reputation is far too high, especially considering the army of hideous humanoids he has working in his toy factory and nestled in the homes of people all over the world. At his command, they are ready to take their grubby little hands and upend entire neighborhoods, taking them apart brick by brick.\nBut, of course, most obviously, did you know that Santa, this jolly fat, though admittedly still very crusty, old man with white hair, is actually Satan? He could be! He\u2019s practically spelled it out with that hideous red he\u2019s always wearing.\n\nThrough His gifts, He is corrupting our precious children. Each gift is a temptation to lure an innocent child to the dark side.\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the \u201cnaughty or nice\u201d list. What, you think he\u2019d give bad kids coal as \u201cpunishment\u201d? Coal is one of the most valuable natural resources. Where could he possibly be getting all that coal from?\u00a0 Yeah, not buying it, Santa.\nThen, all those neighbors you have putting up Christmas decorations? Those are actually signs that your territory is fully corrupted by Santa and his minions. Those lights are a signal for Santa to arrive. The entire block may very well be teeming with Christmas Energy.\n\nCandy canes and peppermints in a home are another red flag you may see. Gingersnaps and fruitcakes are the vessels in which Xmas energy is contracted. If you have to eat one of these horrid items for any reason, you must purge it from your body before it enters your bloodstream. Gingerbread or chocolate chip cookies with cow\u2019s milk are an offering to Santa himself, and if you see this malicious pair lying about on December 24th, dispose of them and hope that The Creature sees your message and does not return.\nIf you have impressionable children, you may not want to disclose the horrifying truth about Santa Claus yet. You may say that he is not real, but be sure to prepare them for the upcoming battle once they are of an age mature enough to process the circumstances. Do not keep up the fa\u00e7ade, even for the children\u2019s sake. It is very easy to succumb to the malevolent energy that is often referred to as Christmas Cheer.\nBe warned, for whether it is June, February, or November, Santa\u2019s forces lurk about and are making constant effort to bring this world to its knees. He is always watching.",

    "content": "When most people think of a magical being, they think of a great and towering dragon in the sky raining fire on the hapless peasants below, or a majestic unicorn skewering soldiers with its horns, or a fairy eating children or whatever fairies do. Unfortunately for the fantasy fans out there, those don't exist. Go back to yelling at people on the internet about Lord of the Rings. Real magic comes from the notorious Shvinkelputin. \nWe all know and love the guy, but for people who don't know, Shvinkelputin is a Scandinavian gnome with mystical-if bizarrely specific-powers. Shvinky hails from a small town in Sweden, where for centuries he made a living off of hiding in mulberry thickets and stealing mulberries from young children passing by. Shvinkelputin also has a particular love of ice weasels. He was appeased every year by the people of the town, who made him a stew of his favorite things: mulberries and ice weasels. However, following a devastating mulberry blight, the Shminker left town and moved to New York City, where his dreams of making it big were promptly crushed like the arguments of internet people with wrong opinions about Lord of the Rings when I'm through with them. \nIn New York, Shvinkelputin faced what may be the greatest evil of them all\u2014the city's high rent and absence of adequate mulberry thickets. Not even magical gnomes can escape the trials and tribulations of finding a job. \nShvinkelputin has attempted to find a job several times with no success. I mean, even if you have two master's degrees, finding a job in this economy is hard enough. What was a poor gnome with magical powers to do? His skills of mulberry theft and ice-weasel-trapping were woefully inadequate in the city, as nobody had any mulberries and ice weasels were nowhere to be found. \nHowever, we at The Radish were sympathetic to this poor Scandinavian gnome's plight, as we did not wish for him to be forever trapped in a contract with an eldritch radish god (praise be unto thee) to serve in the gulag (NOT located in the 9th floor tower) for all of eternity: a situation we definitely can **not** relate to. With generosity and mercy from the Great Ancient One (all hail), we decided to give the shvinkier Putin all the publicity our paper can offer, which is definitely not just the span of one school. He gratefully accepted our offer to interview, seeking to expand his horizons and maybe find a niche for his mulberry and ice weasel related skills. Our talented and only member, Jimmothy McDingus, interviewed him this past week. \n<br />\nSir Jimmothy McDingus: Good evening, Mr. Shvinkelputin. Shvinkelputin: G\u00f8\u00f8d evening. \nJimmothy McDingus, PhD, MD, Itd.: My, that's quite a long and difficult name to pronounce. May perhaps call you Shvinky? \nShvinkelputin: N\u00f8. \nJimmothy McDingus, esq: Ah, very well then. I see you are in search of a job. How has that been going for you? \nShvinkelputin: Not g\u00f8\u00f8d. I ask many places, but none seem to have want f\u00f8r ice weesel \u00f8r mulberry theef! Where are all the ice weesel, I ask. \"Maybe you should go\" they say! Shame on them! Do they say that to the ice weesels, t\u00f8\u00f8?! Maybe that is why there are no ice weesels. \nLord Jimmothy McDingus XI: Well, have you considered perhaps seeking a job that does not involve ice weasels or mulberries? I personally know of a great eldritch being you could pledge to. \nShvinkelputin: J\u00f8b that does... n\u00f8t involve ice weesel \u00f8r mulberry? This is madness! I refuse to speek with such a madman anym\u00f8re! Beg\u00f8ne! Away from my sight. \nCommissar Jimmothy McDingus: I'm sorry, but this is my recording stu \nShvinkelputin: People like you, wh\u00f8reject mulberry and ice weesel are scum! Away, I said! Leeve! \nShvinkelputin then disappeared into a puff of mulberry scented smoke after several attempts to eat our desk, saying something about \u201cthese darn kids with their newfangled table technology.\" \nDespite our less than pleasant encounter, we would like to take this time to wish Shvinkelputin the best of luck in both finding a job and in escaping the horrific genetically mutated radishes that are converging on his location at this very moment. Thank you, dear readers, and as the Ancient One always says. \"meit hseedar dishc em htemoc leseew eci eht ee eE!\" \nEditor's note: ice weasel, for the ice-weaselless New Yorker: \n![Ice Weasel](https://s3-assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/30171339/weasel-1.jpg \"Ice Weasel\")\n\\[Mulberry picture stolen by Shvinkelputin]",

    "content": "Following their latest cycle day mix-up, Brooklyn Tech\u2019s administration decided they\u2019ve had enough! \"No more scheduling mistakes. No more cycle day chaos. No more ten-day cycles,\" their hivemind agreed. Their new proposition: the creatively-named \u201cone-day cycle.\u201d\n\nAs the name might suggest, the principal will now spin a 10-foot wheel every morning, which will land on one of ten possible cycle days. In preparation for this wheel\u2019s arrival, its designers have already rearranged (and thrown out) multiple desks, bookcases, and filing cabinets in the principal's office. This wheel's well-being takes precedence over such trivial items.\nAt first glance, these changes may look quite drastic. Because they are. But, the administration has cited plenty of reasons to justify them, most notably:\n* It's an exciting source of anxiety in a place where anxiety has become mundane and predictable.\n* It promotes equality by rendering both students and teachers helpless to the wheel's whims.\n* The wheel is an amusing way to teach students Murphy\u2019s Law.\nSome students are already experiencing this last point to its fullest: \"I got DDP five days in a row. Please send help,\" one anonymous student told The Radish.\n\nLuckily, the administration can help. For a small fee of $20, you can rig a cycle day to occur at the SGO store. Or, you could buy the silver pack for $45 to schedule three cycle days at once. Get the gold pack, and, for the low price of $80, you can get a shirt, too! Critics may call this an \u201cimmoral cash grab,\u201d but it\u2019s actually all incentive to buy an SGO sticker. You can get a 25% discount on all aforementioned purchases with a sticker! What more could one possibly want from this school\u2019s administration?\n\nAt this rate, the one-day cycle will be one of the greatest changes of all time, entering the realm of overpriced gym locks and mandatory Brooklyn Tech uniforms. Perhaps it can aim even higher. Or lower. In the spirit of the one-day cycle, any of these are possible and all are desirable. All at the spin of a wheel.",

Going into space\u2019s giant black expanse is not as exciting as one may think. I only saw, like, two planets. Maybe three if I squinted.

    "title": "What's Valentine's Day?",
    "authors": ["lawer-nyako"],
    "issue": "february-2022",
    "content": "So my girlfriend and I started dating a few months ago, and almost everything has been great. But things got kinda weird a few weeks ago, around the end of January. I assumed this was because the semester was over. But then she started talking about something happening on the 14th. That\u2019s a bit after the marking period ends, and it\u2019s a day before the only significant day in February, Annoy Squidward Day, which is on the 15th.\u00a0\n\nScared and confused, I asked my two friends about the date. The first one laughed and said they weren\u2019t an expert on Valentine's day and that I should be, being the one with a girlfriend and all. I wondered, what is this mysterious \u201cValentine\u2019s day\u201d? What does my girlfriend have to do with this? The other friend I asked blinked rapidly, seemingly confused, and then ran away saying that they didn\u2019t have the time or patience to explain it. They\u2019re not normally this avoidant.\u00a0\n\nI concluded that discussing this \u201cValentine's day\u201d has adverse effects on adolescents, so I asked my baby cousin. He babbled at me, and while it was very cute, it was not helpful. Later, as I was leaving, my aunt and uncle seemed to be holding back laughter, which was confusing. I mean, yeah the kid was super cute, but they knew that already. Due to their laughter, I doubted they would give a real answer to what was happening on February 14th. I considered asking my parents but they always act weird before the trips they go on this time of year, so I just avoided them.\u00a0\n\nI then decided to check the internet but I ended up seeing a lot about a saint and angel with a harp and bow. There were also a lot of rentals for restaurants, resorts, and exorbitantly-priced plane tickets. There were also sales on chocolate, flowers, and red stuff. This quantity of capitalism was not something I had the patience to understand.\n\nLost, with nowhere left to go, I decided to ask my favorite teacher what this \u201cValentine\u2019s day\u201d is during her office hours. \u201cWhat is Valentine's day,\u201d I asked her. She blinked and laughed at me. Why do people keep laughing at me? I just want to learn about this day. I felt betrayed. She said we could ask anything in office hours.\u00a0\n\nAs I started to leave the classroom, she asked \u201cdo you seriously not know what Valentine\u2019s day is?\u201d and mumbled something along the lines of how this was why her marriage ended when I shook my head \u201cno.\u201d \u201cAnd you\u2019re in a romantic relationship?\u201d Maybe the mention of Valentine\u2019s day has negative effects on adults, too. Why would she want to know if I was single\u2026 I ran.\n\nLater I spoke to my girlfriend about this whole research-finding adventure, she rolled her eyes (likely due to the adverse effects of discussing this date for people), and gave me a heartfelt speech about how much she cared about me. Weird timing for a speech, but it was sweet. Anyway, I\u2019m happy to have shared my escapades on this mysterious new holiday with you all.",

    "content": "Radical Radish News reporting on a recent tragedy at Brooklyn Tech.\nIt was a cold morning that fateful day in late December, that day when a group of students decided to take their chances with Secret Santa and ended up paying the price.\nFive students at Tech, who will remain anonymous to preserve what little dignity they have left, had, for no apparent reason, decided to participate in a Secret Santa, thus subjecting themselves to imminent eternal damnation.\n\nThey were fools pretending as if anyone has enough time to indulge in activities other than trying to finish classwork you never will, attempting homework due the night it was assigned, and studying for a test you weren\u2019t taught the material of.\n\nRegardless, the frivolous \u201cfun\u201d of these students started when the participants found out who they were getting gifts for and their $10 budget was set. Their fates were set.\n\nIn an interview with these anonymous students, Student 1, who received a personalized gift basket he will never open, said, \u201cI was really happy for this round of Secret Santa. I think I got one of the best gifts. It\u2019s such a shame I left my gift at home.\u201d It was indeed a shame.\n\nRRN (Radical Radish News) did not need experts in the field to confirm that this student was lying about his gift being forgotten. He clearly just forgot to get one, and must be lying about leaving it at home. What a liar.\n\nMeanwhile, Student 2 gave the gift basket and received only a mini Snickers bar: \u201cI deserve better than this. Do you literally know how long I spent on that gift basket? It literally took me a whole week. I literally went over the budget and I literally got a tiny Snickers bar. And, oh, look, it\u2019s literally expired. Like how is that even literally possible?\u201d\n\nStudent 2 went all in for this round, a decision she now regrets making. She never did Secret Santa before. This looks like it will be her fateful first, worst, and last time participating in a Secret Santa.\nStudent 3 was the gifter of the Snickers bar and received $9.34 in pennies (934 pennies for you freshmen). In a statement, he said, \u201cI think I gave the best gift out of all of \u2018em.\u201d So, of course, we then reminded the asshole that he gave a $1.50 year-old mini Snickers bar to Student 2. A cruel smirk formed on his face. He responded,\u00a0 \u201chey, you\u2019re not you when you\u2019re hungry.\u201d\n\nWhen we asked how Student 3 felt about the pennies, he said, \u201cWell, I finally have an excuse to get that elevator pass! Screw the stairs! My backpack is just too heavy to take the stairs. They have to let me.\u201d Student 3 has still yet to get that elevator pass, however, and caused a major slowdown of movement in the stairs. That slowdown started an evacuation resulting in a major city-wide traffic jam, and then stopped the supply chains, causing everyone\u2019s stocks to fall, bringing about the spike of oil prices, and, worst of all, Staten Island still being part of NYC. But, not to worry, Student 3 still has all those pennies. At least some things will stay constant.\nStudent 4, who gave $9.34 in pennies, got a live beating heart. The heart pulsated rather distractingly as the student complained about her gift: \u201cWhat the hell am I supposed to do with this? Who's heart was this? I know that one creep likes me; he\u2019s always trying to get me gifts. But this is just too far. Hey, you, can I get a box to store this in?\u201d Rest assured, we gave Student 3 a used takeout box to put the live heart in.\nStudent 5 got his heart broken. Literally. This fool gave the live beating heart. Student 5 did not respond to our request to interview him.\nAnd so Christmas was ruined for everyone, all due to one foolhardy, cult-ritual-like game.\n\nNext time on RNN, the answer to the question you have all been waiting for: \u201cWhen will the scaffolding around Tech come down?\u201d Spoiler alert: It won\u2019t.",

    "title": "How Are Grades Calculated?",
    "authors": ["dylan-horton"],
    "issue": "march-2021",
    "content": "As a student, I have always wondered where grades come from and whether or not actual class performance is a factor of them. After my recent Geometry test, my parents are wondering, too.\n\nLuckily, I have years of internet research to support me. I can firmly tell you that the answer is maybe.\nDuring my years of research, I found a first century document of teaching instructions, giving guidelines for how teachers should grade students. I have translated these guidelines below from Sanskrit:\n1. Part 1\n     Take the percentage of questions the student got right. Once this number is found, all students whose OSIS number matches will be selected for a challenge.\n\n     Selected students must either run around the school basement floor or silently take a muted Fitnessgram\u2122 pacer test. Whichever student does the most laps must yell out a random number for part 2.\n2. Part 2\n     The next section involve students from the city of Philadelphia. Note: they must be from West Philadelphia. The number chosen from part 1 is compared to the number of guys who were up to no good and started makin\u2019 trouble in the fast students\u2019 neighborhood. As far as I know, nothing is done with this information, but it\u2019s good to know.\n     If the random number is greater than or equal to one, the student is sent on a trip to Bel Air. The time it takes for the student to arrive in Bel Air is sent via messenger pigeon to the US Bureau of Statistics.\n3. Part 3\n     Once the pigeon arrives, a government official replaces its batteries, before sending it to watch the to-be-graded students.\n\n     While the bird examines the students, the letter is examined by a CIA agent. They check if any evil Stuyvesant students tampered it. If no tampering is discovered, the letter is thrown down the \u201cA\u201d chute, not to be confused with the \u201cA\u201d chute or the \u201cA\u201d chute. That would result in the percentage from part 1 being used. Some try to claim otherwise, but the chutes have never been mixed up.\n     The \u201cA\u201d chute feeds directly into an industrial-sized meat grinder. Bits of delivered paper will be turned into Beyond meat. That Beyond meat is then molded into a hamburger patty and sent to McDonald\u2019s. Depending on the price of a hamburger with no bun or blue cheese, the student\u2019s grade will either be increased or decreased. This will depend on factors depending on each other and depend on other factors. (I got confused somewhere in the Sanskrit, sorry.)\n\n4. Part 4\n     Once the factored number is calculated, the student\u2019s grade is multiplied by zero. This is their final result.\n\n     On the off chance that the result from part 3 was already zero, the school enters self-destruct mode. Thankfully, this doesn\u2019t seem to have happened for two three days.\n\nAnyway, that is why I failed Geometry in Junior year. Thanks for reading.",

    "content": "<!--StartFragment-->\nIl Vago Ristorante. You've likely never heard of this restaurant before, but this hidden spot serves only the food available. Unlike other similarly-sized restaurants, they\u2019ve been working to serve 99.99% edible food by the year 2030. Though these diligent fellows can be quite secretive about their business, they have been kind enough to allow us at Welp share the Il Vago Ristorante experience!\nJust like any other restaurant, I took a random seat and picked a dish the only way I knew how to: with the roll of a die. 2! That item was the Mystery \u201cMeat.\" I waited expectantly for this classic. After about 10 minutes, an oozing mound of what seemed to be flesh appeared in front of me. I was tempted to walk out then and there, but I persevered for the sake of my journalistic integrity.\nSurprisingly, it tasted like chicken\u2014yet it had the strong flavor of pain. I felt the unique tang of the screams of the damned with every bite. I felt as if I hit rock bottom and then Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson himself tossed me even further.\n\n\"Would you like some fries with that sir?\" my waiter so graciously asked. \"Yes, please.\" I murmured.\nLuckily for my sanity, these fries weren\u2019t quite as inspired. Although I couldn't tell what was underneath their savory crusts, I knew they were most certainly fried. The flavor was exquisite, too. The potatoes, beef, or, could that be the souls of Calculus students? Probably not, no\u2026 Regardless, I highly recommend this dish to anyone who enjoys watching their friends do DeltaMath.\nNewly hopeful, I once again rolled my die. 6! This corresponded to \u201cfood.\u201d Oh no.\nMy waiter returned with a cube(?) of\u2026 something. It didn\u2019t have any smell, texture, or color, so I couldn\u2019t comprehend what I could be staring at. Perhaps tasting it will reveal something, I thought.\nSo, I took a bite or two\u2026 or ten. Despite consuming it with the gusto of a true American patriot, I still couldn\u2019t understand what I ingested. They somehow transformed nothingness into both a flavor and a texture. If this is the true meaning of food, perhaps the definition of the word manifest, then I\u2019m both thrilled and terrified. Thrillified, if you will.\nWelp, this is a great time to have one last dessert and then leave. I mused. With a slight smile on my face, I skimmed through the menu until I reached the desserts: \u201c???\u201d\nScared and sickened, with the flavor of pain still in my throat, I ran.\nRating: \u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606. Would try that cube thing again.\nOriginally published on Welp.net\n\n<!--EndFragment-->",

    "issue": "april-2021",
    "content": "Have you, a Brooklyn Tech student, ever wondered why everything in the school is always broken, and why what is working gets broken for seemingly no reason? Well, you\u2019re not alone. Many other students have noticed this, too. Luckily for you, we have the answer. Today, we reveal an exclusive look at how broken (working) things are fixed (broken) at our school.\nThis process involves a secret committee, known as the Brooklyn Tech Committee Dedicated to Breaking and Poorly Fixing Perfectly Normal, Functioning Things, or the B.T.C.D.B.P.F.P.N.F.T., which is much less of a mouthful.\n\nThe B.T.C.D.B.P.F.P.N.F.T. has two branches, the breaking division and the fixing division. The breaking division consists of a group of ex-boxers, who destroy the chosen object(s) with sledgehammers. The repairing division of the B.T.C.D.B.P.F.P.N.F.T. consists of a large number of toddlers who are currently in pre-k. These individuals in this top-secret organization are tasked with coming up with ideas on how to improve (mess up) the school.\n\nBut first, in order for the ideas to have a drab high school-like feel, the agents are given a Tech student\u2019s homework and tasked with finishing, just to ensure they are ready to move on in the design process.\n\nDuring the design process, these toddlers are tasked with writing down, with a sharpened #2 pencil in 12pt size 14 Times New Roman, MLA format with double spacing, all their ideas on how to fix (break) whatever object is selected. Any ideas that do not fit this format are discarded, and the best (worst) idea out of all of them is selected.\n\nOnce the process is finished, the B.T.C.D.B.P.F.P.N.F.T. needs to wait 5-11 years to get all the required paperwork and permits to start construction. Such permits include:\n* A permit to hire workers\n* A permit to pay workers\n* A permit to work in a school building\n* One permit for each worker so they are allowed to work and get paid\n* A permit to summon a demon lord (preschool teacher)\n* And a permit to acquire the permits listed above\nAfter this, and another year of construction, the object in question is now repaired (broken). Now all the students get to notice, comment and complain about the now broken (fixed) item. So, if you ever wondered why the stairways now and forever will smell like paint thinner, you can always thank the B.T.C.D.B.P.F.P.N.F.T.",

I sat down with him to discuss his piece.\nINTERVIEWER: Now, does your policy extend only to cakes? \nRANCH: My policy extends to every damn thing the sun shines on. Kids nowadays are being taught that sharing means caring and whatnot. I remember when being roughed up a little, walking home in the snow, built character.\nINTERVIEWER: I think what people are upset about is your approach to dealing with children. You said, and I quote: \"That was the day I looked that ungrateful eight year old in the eye and said 'make me.\" Is that correct?\nRANCH: Well, yes it is. My grandson needs to learn the benefits of personal responsibility when he's young. I'm not making the same mistakes I did with my children-\nINTERVIEWER: If you don't mind me asking, what do your children do? \nRANCH: They're both licensed therapists. Something about having to work through their issues. I'm not sure what issues they could have, but sometimes life's too tough for the sofites I've raised. \nINTERVIEWER: Uhuh. \nRANCH: I ask that ungrateful daughter of mine to choose the cake. Surprise me, I say. And she gets vanilla! Who in their right mind gets vanilla? \nINTERVIEWER: Maybe she just likes vanilla? \nRANCH: Well she likes Jazz too, so maybe I should stop letting her make decisions. \nINTERVIEWER: Right. \nRANCH: Besides, Thomas is starting to look like he could use a little less cake. \nINTERVIEWER: And is Thomas your child or grandchild? \nRANCH: My grandson, but both could benefit from cutting back on carbs. He patted his own gut with a sigh. \nINTERVIEWER: So is your solution giving everyone their own cake? \nRANCH: They've really got you, haven't they? I'm saying everyone should buy their own cake. I thought that was obvious. \nINTERVIEWER: And that includes Thomas? \nRANCH: Boy's got legs, hasn't he? He could set up a lemonade stand. Or mow the lawn. No age is too young to contribute to society. \nINTERVIEWER: And do you believe in owning pets? Considering they don't do much? \nRANCH: Don't patronize me. \nAnd that's all I managed to write down before my brain clonked out.",

    "content": "<!--StartFragment-->\nMost everyone\u2019s heard of a dishwasher, but not many know how to use one properly. In this article, you will learn how to CORRECTLY use a dishwasher in a lovely step-by-step format that the graphics team will love! Read it you slobbery fellow.\n\n1. Get your dishes.\n\n   To use a dishwasher you must have dishes. Obviously. I mean, it\u2019s not called a potato washer, now IS IT. Anyway, you need dishes. And lots of them. I bet you won't have a problem with that, HUH. You seem like you use soooo many dishes, you dirty little DISH BOY. Ick, so dirty.\n\n2. Rinse the dishes\n   Next, you have to rinse the dishes. Do you know what rinsing is? Probably not, because you don't seem to ever rinse yourself. You turn on the sink and run the dishes under the water. This gets off ALL of your sticky little smelly grime that you ate that takes a little effort to get off the plate. Now you may be thinking that now that you rinsed them, they don't need to go into the dishwasher but NO! NO NO NO! They are STILL DIRTY. Jeez. Makes sense coming from YOU, doesn't it.\n\n3. Put the dishes into the dishwasher\n   Now what you need to do is put the dishes INTO the dishwasher. Don\u2019t just rinse them and put them next to the sink. Is it really that hard to just place them inside? NO, it ISN\u2019T! I bet you have trouble with that though, with you being all dirty. I bet when you put the dishes into the dishwasher you get them DIRTIER than when you STARTED. So unhelpful. I bet you\u2019re your parents' SECOND favorite child.\n\n4. Start the dishwasher\n   Now you start the dishwasher. Um. I think you um pour the liquid over the plates and then like close it and then um press the start button. Right? I should know. I am writing the article. Wait this isn\u2019t about me, it's about YOU and your SMELLLLLLLYY DISSSSSHESSSS. They're SOOO SMELLLLY so you have to make sure you get the um liquid all over it. Oh, what liquid? I think it's like laundry detergent right? Phoenix told me dishwashers worked like washing machines, so obviously they use the same stuff.\n\n5. Take the dishes out!\n   Moving on, once the dishes have baked at 350 degrees for 45 minutes they can be put back into your cabinets. I\u2019ve found that the most efficient way is to take them all out at once and, like, shove them in and, like, pray it doesn't break. You can do that right? You can do ONE SIMPLE THING in your life, right? Probably not. You\u2019ll just get the dishes all dirty. Again. Then you\u2019ll have to wash them. Again. Jesus christ this article was pointless.\n<!--EndFragment-->",

    "content": "Brooklyn Tech's SGO sticker, once an item used only for club credits and discounts at school events, has recently been given a new use for non-students: a gym membership. \nAt first, the school was hesitant to introduce the policy. That stopped when sales of SGO stickers skyrocketed\u2014people all across the city have been scrambling to get their hands on the stickers so that they can access to Brooklyn Tech's state-of-the-art gym facilities, including the innovative running track suspended above the first-floor gym and high-tech mechanical workout equipment in the weight training rooms.\nInitially, the membership access only allowed people to use the school's gymnasiums on the weekends, when all of the pesky students aren't hogging the space and equipment. But the stickers were so popular that the school decided to give people access on the weekdays. \nOne person about the subscription: \"My favorite part about the Brooklyn Tech gyms is the temperature. The hot and stuffy air makes finishing my workout even more rewarding.\"\nAnother frequent user of the gym facilities at Tech spoke about the extra health benefits of running around the track. \"Going on that track triggers my fear of heights, which really gets my heart rate going. I only have to exercise for half as long as I used to!\"\nWhile some students expressed discontent over the new policy, the Physical Education Department at Brooklyn Tech has deemed it \"a huge success.\" \nWhen asked about the potential safety and overcrowding concerns of letting random adults use the gyms at the same time as students, administrators said they were \"still working on\" a solution. The administrators also cited a poll that was put out by the school about whether or not people approve of the new policy, saying that \u201c95 percent of responders said that they liked the memberships.\" After being asked whether the poll was given to students at Brooklyn Tech, they responded by saying that \"the students only make up about 10 percent of gym users, so it wouldn't really affect the numbers that much. Either way, it is clear that the response to the new policy has been overwhelmingly positive.\" \n",

    "content": "*The following article is a recording of real world events. All details have been taken from the perspective of a BTHS student, graduating 2023, who has asked to remain anonymous. They have agreed to detail their experiences to the Radish.*\n![THE SCHEDULE](https://storage.googleapis.com/radish-2bd31.appspot.com/old-assets/the-schedule-.png \"THE SCHEDULE\")\n*\\[MUFFLED] Do I just speak into this microphone? Really close? Oh, but keep the mask on right. Yeah, yeah, I gotchu.*\nSo, basically, over the summer I signed up for this really weird program. The school promised they\u2019d give me a brand-new schedule like no student has ever had before. So, of course, I thought, \u201cHey, a four-to-five schedule has never been done before. I could totally do that. There's has to be a first time for everything.\u201d\n\nNowhere along the line did I expect to get a full schedule- no, I\u2019m not kidding, classes all periods. I am \u201clearning\u201d straight through periods 1 to 10.\nOf course, the hours are not even the worst part. These are all new classes! How am I even supposed to get study guides for these?\nYeah, have you ever tried to bake muffins and also build a shelf to get out of quicksand at the same time? Well, HomeEcShop taught us that\u2019s something all adults need to learn. I can't say they're wrong, though; I haven't been an adult before.\nI was told that colleges would like it more if I took hard AP classes, so I went and saw what people told me to be the hardest AP class: AP AP. I'm truly not sure as to what the whole curriculum is about. I read the syllabus and it felt like a jumble of words to me. I took a practice exam to see if I\u2019d get anything and I felt like I was bubbling in my random choices in a tiny hut in a desert. Genuinely, taking the test made me feel a little delirious.\u00a0 My teacher says I'm on the path to getting a 5, though, and that\u2019s all that really matters.\nOn a completely different note, Drag Race gym was a new addition to the curriculum, since New York City has such an expansive drag scene. Maybe the only semi-decent class. Taking this class has given me such a genuine appreciation for the art, especially after we had to run half a mile in full makeup and heels. Serving absolute beat and giving a sharp read are not easy things to do though. Becoming Prissa Teen is a straight vibe, but if you wanna work the stage, you gotta work hard first. I only wish the tests weren\u2019t graded so harshly and I wasn't so out of breath running to my next class after Lip Sync Battle days.\nAlright, so now imagine Org Chem but without the Org or the Chem. That\u2019s what Carbon Studies is. We\u2019ve been studying graphite for the past month and I wish I knew less about it. Did you know graphite was once called plumbago? Have you heard that graphite is anisotropic thermally and acoustically? Did you ever learn th-\n\n*Could we move on?*\n\nExcuse me?\n*Our readers don\u2019t want to hear about this, so it\u2019s best we move on.*\nSo I spent months learning about carbon, and you\u2019re just going to silence me like thi- *click*.\nAP Lunch is honestly way too difficult. I can never find anyone to sit with, and it always feels like the cafeteria is empty every time I\u2019m there. I just feel like I\u2019m alone in my own little bubble. 0/5 experience.\nI really wanted to take AP Gaming. They told me that it would be a new course. Instead? They put me into AP Computer Science. I will assume that I'm going to learn how to make video games here since it's my replacement. So far the teacher has just been spitting gibberish at me and I'm pretty sure I'm four units behind. Every other kid I ask is telling me that I'm taking the wrong course, but AP Computer Science appears on other kids\u2019 schedules. I'm pretty sure this is the right course. Now, is it weird that no one shares the same teacher as me? Maybe. But, hey, look, I did sign up for the experimental schedule. BTHS might have just given me an experimental teacher.\nAP Free Period has to be one of the most disappointing classes I\u2019ve ever had. I thought I was going to be able to just sleep the whole time, but it turns out that we have to either study or stare at the teacher for the entire period. They take points off for improper eye contact with the teacher, too. Honestly, I'm surprised I'm even passing this class. It seems almost impossible to stay awake. The whole time the teacher plays ASMR in the background with gentle dings from a\u2026 small Tibetan Bell\u2026 I'm getting tired\u2026 just talkin\u2019 about\u2026 it\u2026\u00a0\n\nI was able to take Counting as my chosen math class to get the required credits. It\u2019s incredibly boring and monotonous, however. We\u2019re only on number 27. I\u2019m really just counting my days until I get out of this painful class\u2014though I\u2019m fairly sure it\u2019ll be more than 27 days, so I\u2019m not really sure how to do that.\n\nIf I were to give you the most applicable class to my life in my entire schedule, it would be AP Existential Crisis. This schedule doesn\u2019t make anything feel real anymore. Everyday in school feels like the most boring nightmare to be in. Each day feels two days long. I can\u2019t tell if this interview is even real anymore, or if I\u2019ve just been speaking into a brick.\n\nAre you happy now? Is this what the Radish wanted? This stupid club just uses my own traumatic experiences as content for their articles, and I- *click*.",

    "content": "It\u2019s been a long, difficult year. COVID-19 has left us torn apart, failing our classes, and generally mentally unwell. But fear not, we have a solution! Here\u2019s a complete list of summer activities recommended by us here at The Radish.\n1. Take More Tests\n     Stress is great for students. Strangely, students have felt worse, despite the best efforts of politicians, teachers, and parents to apply more stress. But with more tests, you\u2019ll be pulling your hair out with anxiety (and that\u2019s a good thing).\n2. Fight Your Friends\n     Students have spent a long time away from their friends. What better way to get close with them again than to physically and emotionally assert yourself as the alpha? Forget honesty and emotional compatibility. All you need to be close with your friends is a good old-fashioned brawl.\n3. Spend Every Day Inside and Hope for a Day When You Can See the People You Hold Dear\n\n     Who doesn\u2019t love a 2020 blast from the past?\n4. Forget the Past School Year\n     This one is easy and pretty much guaranteed. There\u2019s nothing quite like waking up in early July and remembering that putting mental energy into geometry is just a memory. What\u2019s more relaxing than forgetting what a postulate is?\n\n5. Browse The Radish January 2021 Issue\n     I mean\u2026 it\u2019s worth a shot?\n6. Spend Money!\n     Money exists to be spent. So, why not waste it on products you don\u2019t need? Just keep consuming and chasing your goals of wealth accumulation. Happiness will have to come someday, right?\n7. Take a Long, Good Look in the Mirror\n     Who are you? What have you become? What are you doing with your life? What happened to those dreams you had?\n\n     A good follow-up to this activity is laying in bed and staring at the ceiling until you fall asleep at an unreasonable hour.\n8. Make Yourself Some Clam Chowder\n     What\u2019s more comforting than clam chowder? A lot of things. But all you deserve is clam chowder. Now eat.\nTry these this summer and have a blast, because nothing\u2019s better for your sense of freedom than following a list made by people you don\u2019t know.",

    "title": "'Juice pouches are the official cool cid drink, company spokesperson claims'",
    "authors": ["aramie-ewen"],
    "issue": "june-2021",
    "content": "In a wildly controversial post last Wednesday, a spokesperson of Pouchy Juice claimed juice pouches are the official \u201ccool cid\u201d drink. To see how this has impacted cool kid communities, I decided to infiltrate the \u201ccool cid cliques\u201d myself. Those people of a higher class, or grade, if you will.\n\u201cThey can\u2019t tell us what our cool cid drink is! NO! I don\u2019t wanna,\u201d a self-nominated cool kid spokesperson informed me. Notably, they drank a juice pouch anyway. \u201cThey taste good.\u201d These cool kids are on another level of opposing authority\u2014especially their own.\n\nBut another self-appointed cool kid spokesperson disagreed. They raged, \u201cSome cool cids say I can\u2019t drink juice pouches and be a cool cid, but I am a cool cid! I am! I\u2019m so cool! I don\u2019t care what they think.\u201d Unfortunately, they got so wrapped up in their words I couldn\u2019t make out the last bit of their argument. My best attempt was, \u201caaawaaawaaahuuh.\u201d\n\nJuice pouch grasped firmly in one hand, unsheathed straw in the other, another cool kid then nominated themself as spokesperson. Shouting, they said, \u201cLike promises, juice pouches weren\u2019t made to be broken!\u201d They then shoved their straw at the juice pouch, but it folded in half. This spokesperson then proved themself a true cool kid, only crying for half an hour. Their comrades gazed on in respect.\n\n\u201cI am not a cool cid, but you have to be cinda grown-up to do that,\u201d an onlooker muttered, pointing at the cool kid recovering from the straw break. They were slowly sipping their own juice pouch. And, from I saw by that point, I would say that makes them a cool kid spokesperson, too.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on,\u201d some random kid said, passing by. While it is important to get outside perspectives, this kid is clearly wrong. They had no juice pouch. They did not speak \u201ckid\u201d as \u201ccid.\u201d\n\nSince I was here, I also decided to answer one other question, although a bit unrelated to juice pouches: why \u201ccool cids\u201d and not \u201ckool kids,\u201d or \u201ccool kids\u201d? But when I tried to explain my question to one of the cool kid spokespeople, they feigned innocence. \u201cWhat? You\u2019re just saying the same thing three times.\u201d As the cool kid they are, they held up three fingers to help me.\n\nAnother self-appointed cool kid spokesperson came up to me then. I\u2019ll never forget their words, \u201cYou\u2019ve punctured your last pouch, punk,\u201d spoken before I was taken away from the cool kids in a police car for \u201cbreaking into a preschool.\u201d",

    "content": "I\u2019ve always had trouble with school. Every time I take a test, it\u2019s like some fundamental part of me breaks. I can\u2019t bear to turn the test in. Nothing about school in the past has seemed to make me feel less of myself, not even having to ask extra questions or doing mediocre classwork. It took me a while before I realized what was wrong.\n\nAt first, I\u2019d be quiet the whole day, not giving any sort of attention to the lessons of the day, mainly because all that I could think about was the upcoming test. During the test, I\u2019d work my hardest, but the whole time I\u2019d be in a daze of some sort, unable to rein in my thoughts. I\u2019d be seething and raging when I got home, absolutely devastated about my test. But my worry wasn\u2019t about the grade.\nDuring my midterms, I started to panic. I wasn\u2019t able to control my impulses. I held my scantron and packet close in my arms and ran out the room, making a leaping dive for the staircases, which I promptly tumbled down. Sure, I was covered in bruises, but my test and I were free! No longer did I have to just give away my hard work! I didn\u2019t have to let those filthy adults scribble all over my precious baby with red and black ink! I gave my midterms a fat sloppy kiss and ran home to frame it in my room. Public transportation be damned, I reached my home in a record 10 minutes! After framing my special treasure on my wall, I began to make a mural around the golden spot where my test rested.\nKnowing this happiness, there\u2019s no way I could let the teachers try and take another test from me. I keep the tests of the month in my closet, my bag, and my locker. Not even the quizzes go neglected. And, sure, you may say that this makes the zeroes pile up. You may say that I have no more room in my closet for my clothes. You might even claim that my behaviors are obsessive and unhealthy, but my papers are safe, and that\u2019s all that matters to me. I\u2019m happy. I will fight tooth and nail for that right.\nMy teachers, advisors, and guidance counselors have no idea what it was like to feel all that anxiety without an explanation. I\u2019m never going back to that. They may say that my hissing and kicking is deranged, but tell me, beloved reader, which is more deranged? Stealing a piece of hard work from an innocent student, or keeping your test papers safe?",

    "content": "Grammarly autocorrected Carol Branchirem\u2019s first name to \u201ccheating lying hussy\u201d while she was typing up a letter for her grandkids last Tuesday. Mrs. Branchirem didn\u2019t notice and ended up sending the letter to her grandchildren, who are too young to understand what lying and cheating means. However, Mrs. Branchirem\u2019s daughter noticed and let a writer here at The Radish know. \nAfter investigating, we found out that the CEO of Grammarly, Peter Dingbiscuit, was cheated on by his wife. Her name happened to be Carol. \nWe spoke to an ex-programmer for Grammarly about this autocorrect situation. She revealed that typing the name \u201cCarol\u201d will correct you to Dingbisuit\u2019s description of his soon-to-be ex-wife\u2014explaining Mrs. Branchirem\u2019s signoff last Tuesday. \nAccording to our anonymous outside source, Peter Dingbiscuit had a record of being extremely petty. He often throws tantrums when things don\u2019t go his way and always thinks of the most obscene ways to get revenge on people. Because he consistently gets swept up in \u201csuper secret scary elaborate schemes,\u201d it wasn\u2019t surprising that his wife would have an affair. \nThis incident wasn\u2019t the first time Dingbiscuit programmed a word to autocorrect into something seemingly unrelated. In fact, this has happened so frequently that we compiled a short list for you all: \n- Fred Blobsmear \u2192 I hate you so much if you have this name.\n- Leather Pants \u2192 The worst pants ever. \n- Fuscia \u2192 THE COLOR OF FRED\u2019S DISGUSTING BELLY BUTTON\n- August 17th \u2192 The day *that* person was pushed out of a woman.\n- Horrible mistake \u2192 FRED.\n- Notorious Rock Kuqwix Dwerryhouse \u2192 <span class=\"blacked-out\">\\*\\*\\*\\*</span><span class=\"blacked-out\">\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*</span><span class=\"blacked-out\">\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*</span><span class=\"blacked-out\">\\*\\*\\*</span><span class=\"blacked-out\">\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*</span><span class=\"blacked-out\">\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*</span><span class=\"blacked-out\">\\*\\*\\*</span>!\nWe had to censor the last autocorrection. It wasn\u2019t suitable for anyone younger than thirty-two. According to Dingbiscuit\u2019s wif- our anonymous outside source, we learned that Notorious Rock Kuqwix Dwerryhouse is the man Dingbiscuit\u2019s wife had an affair with. \nAfter this situation came to light, Dingbiscuit resigned as the CEO of Grammarly. He has been hiding in his parents\u2019 attic ever since. Now, people all over the world know not to ever cross Mr. Peter Dingbiscuit. \nThank you for reading. Make sure to always proofread whatever you write; you don\u2019t want to accidentally make a FRED.\n",

    "content": "Here I am, walking out of class. It\u2019s a normal day, like any other. Leaving the boys bathroom, the room which my class was in, the mysterious liquid on the floor is still clinging to my shoe. Is it water? Pee? Something worse? I don\u2019t know, and quite frankly I don\u2019t care.\nI walked past the vending machine, eyeing up all the snacks I can\u2019t afford. Funables. Yum. I arrive at the staircase and open the door, shoving a ninth grader as I make my way through. He\u2019s so small, so naive to the horrors that await on those steps\u2026 those dark, evil steps.\nI took one step, hah, step\u2026 funny. Then, I, and all my pride, topple. I\u2019m falling. The chain link walls of the staircase rattle as my tumbling body flops into them and I am overcome with fear.\nSuddenly, I hear a splash, my elbow slips into some brown liquid. \u201cAh, yes,\u201d I think. \u201cDiarrhea.\u201d Some gets in my mouth. It\u2019s just chocolate milk. I can tell by the taste of cardboard and feet. Delicious.\n\nI think back to the man I used to be. I remember doing things like going to class, peeing, and peeing in class (weird day). Standing, in all of my arrogance. I\u2019m not falling. From an outside perspective, it may seem like I\u2019m frantically battling the forces of gravity and getting horribly beaten, but this is not the case. Falling implies a state of being, whereas I simply am not being. I amn\u2019t.\n\nWho have I become? No longer the pompous student am I. Carrying my books, my burdens. I may be stuck, tumbling down these wretched steps, yet somehow I\u2019m freer than I've ever been. I see myself, my body. I look like a nerd. Am I astral projecting? Perhaps. I never thought I would have to confront a version of myself stripped of all dignity, of all hope in this desolate world. However, that day has come. I\u2019m forced to ask myself: if a kid falls in a staircase and there\u2019s nobody around, does he ever even crash, or even make a sound?\\\nAnd then I crash into one of the walls and I scream as loud as I can. My elbow launches down into the riser of a step with enough force to launch my feet above my head. I\u2019m flipped over. For a moment, I know what it feels like to live upside down.\n\nHow does upside down me walk, I think. How does he talk? What are his wishes, dreams, aspirations? I immediately think about my upside down family, my upside down wife, Susan. What will she think when I don\u2019t come home to our upside down family tonight? She\u2019s already mad at me for being behind on my upside down taxes, and I don\u2019t know how much longer I can take the cold shoulder.\n\nI awaken from my daydream. At least I will never have to face Susan now. The steps put thoughts in your head, it\u2019s easy to get lost in them. Last time I fell on the stairs I dreamt that I was a teacher at Tech. Can you believe this new testing schedule they gave u\u2013 Forgive me, the stairs came over me again. I came back with tears streaming down my face; what a horrid life.\n\nIt feels as though I\u2019ve lived many lives as I\u2019ve fallen. In some way, I\u2019m more the falling me than I am the static me. No longer am I the nerdy boy who lights trash cans on fire and pees in class. I am flight. I am motion. A blur. I am falling, and I am free.",

(Some would call him an influencer but he got angry when we didn't say everything he really does.) This former Brooklyn Tech student and Brooklyn native skyrocketed to popularity with his generic good looks and whimsical-yet-grounded personality. However, in this new exclusive interview, Braillyn says that he has only recently reached his greatest goal in life: getting on a lunchbox.\nHe said, \u201cEvery sub-goal I reach, every follower I get, while I appreciate it, I honestly feel nothing. Each goal is just a means to an end. Every person who engages with my content is just one more person I can use to reach my real goal for life.\u201d\nBraillyn, under the username Branno (previously xXExtremeyCoolXx), has recently reached 8.67563782 million subscribers on YouTube, 7975 thousand followers on Instagram, and over 6 followers on Twitter (unclear how many are bots). Thanks to his great fame, Braillyn has had multiple movie studios approach him, but he has turned nearly all of them down.\n\n\u201cIn all of my contracts,\u201d according to Braillyn, \u201cI request no money directly from the studio and no box office or DVD profits. However, I always ask my character to have my face and for this character to be on the lunchbox merchandise that must be released alongside the film. I would also like to directly receive all profits the lunchboxes bring in, although this clause is slightly negotiable.\u201d\nIt has taken many years for Braillyn to find a movie studio that will give into such a specific contract, but it has recently been announced he will be starring as main love interest #6 in *The Shippening* from BreakHert Studios\u2014and Braillyn couldn\u2019t be more excited.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t give any spoilers on the film, but one thing I can tell you is that there will be a lot of merch coming out for this movie,\u201d Braillyn said, shaking in his chair. \u201cBut, one thing I can tell you is that all the lip syncs, challenge videos, and collabs with now-cancelled creators were all worth it. My character will be on a lunchbox. I, Braillyn Sonsmithson, will be ON A LUNCHBOX!\u201d\n**Update from 6 months in the future:**\nWhile The Shippening was a commercial failure, Braillyn has made millions of dollars due to his fans buying so many of the lunchboxes. Due to his contract, BreakHert Studios has made no money due to the lunchboxes, and with multiple box office flops, the studio has now gone bankrupt. Braillyn has yet to be sued.",

You\u2019ll find a wide variety of unpleasant conditions, all of them new, so pop that Pepto, chug those Antihistamines, warm up those particle accelerators, and get ready to shut yourself inside for three months! Again! I swear if there\u2019s another lockdown, I\u2019m gonna-\nStarting off strong, we\u2019ve got an allergy to stairs! That\u2019s right, guys, gals, and nonbinary pals, for those of you who really need an elevator pass, we\u2019re bringing back the Stair Allergy! It went on hiatus last year to deal with its divorce, but it's back and ready to slay! Symptoms range from an upset stomach to dizziness to spontaneous combustion whenever your foot touches a stair! If you want an elevator pass, this ones for you! You can pick it up by licking the third rail at any platform in Atlantic Terminal. Happy sampling!\nNext up, we\u2019ve got the holographic food allergy ultra-rare wild card of this season: The Cardboard and Glue Dynamic Duo! Now, we\u2019re all high school students here. We might pull all-nighters and forget breakfast, so we might, on occasion, go to Rocky\u2019s\u00a0 and buy 30 pounds of cardboard and glue as a pre-1st period snack. Wait, you guys don\u2019t do that? Well, if you did, you can\u2019t anymore. Cardboard and glue have been classified by the FDA, CIA, NSA, CVS, and CTC as Sigma Level Allergens, as \u201cavoid this like you would avoid someone who unironically calls themselves a sigma.\u201d\nYou know this one, you hate this one, but she\u2019s back, now with more protein spikes! It\u2019s Pollen II: Mucus Boogaloo! (Expecting something else with protein spikes? No idea what you\u2019re talking about.) Pollen II is like the pollen from flowers but found in computer motherboards instead. And they called me crazy for writing this article on a typewriter I stole from R. L. Stine! If you needed another reason to shun the kids in the programming major and/or skip APCSP, Pollen II\u2019s got your back! Symptoms are like normal pollen allergy symptoms but multiplied by a million. We\u2019re not kidding. or ;\u00a0 we tested it and measured it three times. Word of advice: don\u2019t let someone with this allergy sneeze in a confined space. There\u2019s enough snot to drown at least 5 test-subject-sized humans\u2026 I mean, what? Who said that?\nLast up, we\u2019ve got an allergy to the Internet. I know, right? Everywhere I go, I see kids, teens, adults, hell, just last week, I saw an old lady with a walker on the B train getting a triple kill on Valorant. They\u2019re all using the Internet. No longer with this new ailment! Combined with the Pollen II allergy, we should probably just get rid of computing devices altogether. Look on the bright side; at least we won\u2019t have any more Google Classroom homework! You\u2019ll be able to tell if you have this one: if you\u2019re within 100 feet of a router or server, you\u2019ll explode! You know, I\u2019m really not regretting setting up this biological weapons laboratory and cooking up all these new allergens in the middle of the Pacific Northwest forests. The smell of redwoods and people exploding works wonders on the sinuses!\nAll right, Tech students, that\u2019s a top 4 list of my personal favorite allergies due to drop in 2022. Of course, there are so many more that I haven\u2019t mentioned. I look forward to the carnage that\u2019ll ensue in the spring. But then again, it wouldn\u2019t be a Tech spring without carnage. I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Wear your masks, people, and remember to smile under them. Till we meet again.",

Students and colleagues recently mourned the one year anniversary of his disappearance, but we were happy to give them some closure with the confirmation that he is not, in fact, dead. His body and being was simply snatched up by God in the dead of night to join Him in His kingdom of eternal light. \nNow left in the place where he once stood lies a question: why only him?

Well, the hardworking reporters at The Radish have done a deep dive and are happy to announce that we can answer this question.\nThrough Radish informants in the underworld, I was able to get the full explanation of this odd situation. Apparently, the problem starts with a misunderstanding of what the rapture is. Common understanding of the rapture is that those who believe in the blessed one (God) will be taken to heaven to live out the rest of eternity with Him. However, in actuality, the blessed ones (person) ascend to live out eternity with God. This mistake was attributed to a mistranslated sentence when the Bible was translated from its original script to Latin. God, finding it funny, decided to let it slide. But this caused evangelicals to focus their energy on believing when they should have spent their time blessing. So, how was Mr. Smith able to become the only blessed one? My contacts in the underworld, not knowing what happened up above, kicked me out. I was forced to go to Iowa to figure this out.\nThe first few things I learned upon meeting the people who knew Mr. Smith while he roamed this planet seemed inconsequential. He liked churning butter and became a teacher after he failed to go pro. He didn't believe in washing his hands, sick days, or germ theory in general, and did not like it when his students didn't participate in class. Eighty percent of their grade was participation, which they counted themselves by hand on a tallyboard anytime they said anything, so classes tended to go off track a lot. In many ways, Mr. Smith seemed to be a man stuck in the past-\nThe writer of this article has since been seized by rapture, too. \n",

    "content": "So I know this one guy. You don\u2019t need to know his name, I\u2019ve already told you enough. He\u2019s alright, I guess. We hang out a lot. He\u2019s a loser and a failure. He\u2019s my best friend, even, some would say. (We hate each other.)\nOne day I asked if he wanted to hang out after school, but said he couldn\u2019t. He said he had a \u201cdate.\u201d \nObviously, I laughed in his face. \u201cWith who?\u201d I asked.\nOh, you wouldn\u2019t know her, he said, and his expression immediately changed. He stops, his face somber. He looks me in the eyes, and says, as if taken by a bout of utter sobriety, \u201cShe goes to another school.\u201d\nA month goes by. The \u201cdate\u201d incident, if it could even be called that, was never mentioned again. I just assumed he was pulling my leg. Doing a funny. Rustling my jimmies. \nOne time we were talking about graduation and how it feels being a senior and all that. I ask him if he\u2019s going to prom. \u201cOf course, my girlfriend really wants to go.\u201d I freeze. I grab my water bottle, take a sip and spit it into his face in shock. \n\u201cWith your alleged girlfriend?\u201d\n\u201dYeah,\u201d he says, wiping off my spit take from his face.\n\u201cWho is she?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s amazing,\u201d he continues, beginning to grin, \u201cShe brings me flowers and shiny things.\u201d\n\u201cYeah but like\u2026who is she?\u201d\n\u201cShe goes to another school,\u201d he shrugs.\nI decided to go all in. \u201cWhy is she going out with you? Full offense.\u201d\n\u201cShe thinks I\u2019m funny. She also said my soul was ripe for the picking or whatever.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026What.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. She\u2019s just quirky like that.\u201d A pause. \u201cShe goes to another school,\u201d he adds quietly, almost to himself.\nAnd just like that, the conversation was over. \nI catch him hurrying off after school carrying a bag full of rocks and an unknown green substance. I ask him where he\u2019s going.\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m having dinner with my girlfriend. Sorry man, I gotta go. She lives all the way by the creek.\u201d\n\u201dThe one in the middle of the woods?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s a little weird?\u201d\n\u201cNot really. She\u2019s just #cottagecore. I should get this dinner to her. She gets kind of cranky and filled with the wrath of the forest spirits when she\u2019s hungry. Women, amirite?\u201d\nNow, every once in a while, I spot him rushing off with the mysterious bag of rocks and goo. It seemed random at first, (after all, he\u2019s just a quirky little guy), but after I realized the occurrences coincided with full moons, I couldn\u2019t take it anymore.\nThe next day I confronted him. I said, \u201cWe need to talk about your girlfriend.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about her?\u201d\n\u201cDude, there\u2019s something off about her!\u201d\n\u201cShe goes to an-\u201c\n\u201cStop saying she goes to another school. There\u2019s only one school in this town!\u201d\nHe narrows his eyes. \u201cI see what\u2019s going on here. Dude, no need to be jealous. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a girl out there for you who doesn\u2019t care about looks, or personality, or having standards, or-\u201c\n\u201cI\u2019m not jealous. I\u2019m just worried about you.\u201d\nHis eyes widened. \u201cOh, I think I get it! I\u2019m flattered, really I am, but I\u2019m taken. My heart belongs to my girlfriend. My soul, too. And my firstborn.\u201d\n\u201cYou know what? I give up. Go ahead, date your freaky mystery girl but don\u2019t come crawling back when she tries to vore you! I don\u2019t know who or what she is and I don\u2019t care anymore!\u201d\n\u201cWell, obviously you don\u2019t know! She goes to another school.\u201d\nI\u2019m so enraged, I have nothing to do but accept my fate. I go to the forest, take a smelly poopy and die. How can I compete with a girl who eats rocks and goo! Especially one from another school! \n",

You were the first out of your seat and out the door. Classes were over, and you couldn\u2019t wait to go home and watch Fortnite Funnies: The Anime Spinoff for the next 35 hours like the shut-in you were. But just as you got to the school\u2019s exit, someone tapped you on the shoulder.\n\u201cSalutations Y/N.\u201d The tall guy with dark hair who had just gotten your attention pushed up his glasses, creating a gleam that obscured his eyes. \u201c\u2018Tis Survey from your geometry class. Would you like to go to the public library on Saturday? I took some excellent notes in geometry I\u2019d like to share with you. I know you\u2019re not the best at math.\u201d He looked down at you, a smirk playing on his lips. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s the weekend but I might have to pick up my baby brother from kindergarten.\u201d You replied, lying through your teeth. Your mother usually picked up your little brother. You felt bad lying to Survey; it was true that your geometry skills were inadequate, and Survey was the most attractive boy in class, but under no circumstances could anyone interrupt your hobbies. \nAn ecstatic voice boomed across the foyer, interrupting Survey from speaking. It was Radish, wearing a bright red Hawaiian shirt adorned with bananas and a pair of aviator sunglasses without the lenses. \n\u201cHEY Y/N! THERE YOU ARE!\u201d Radish ran up and shoved his beaming face in front of yours, causing Survey to step away.\nDespite his questionable behaviour, you found Radish\u2019s personality to be oddly electrifying. You wouldn\u2019t say that you were attracted to Radish, but something about him was so compelling. \n\u201cWhat do you want, baka? You know it\u2019s rude to shove your face in front of others,\u201d you replied, a scowl forming on your face, though it did a terrible job to hide your blush. \n\u201cI dunno, just wanted to say hi,\u201d Radish replied, grinning like the fool he was. He took off his sunglasses, revealing a pair of stunningly smaragdine eyes. Your heart started to beat faster; Radish was undeniably cute with his long eyelashes and big eyes.\n\u201cTh- then leave, gosh,\u201d you reply,  playfully rolling your eyes. Any normal bystander would think you\u2019re annoyed. But, if they knew how to read between the lines, they would know that your pupils screamed, \u201cI want you to chu-chu me wight now uwu~\u201d Luckily, Radish was decently literate.\nRadish smirked again, his grin widening and showing his teeth. \u201cNow that I think about it, there is something I wanted to ask you.\u201d\nThis time Survey rolled his eyes, trying to hide his disgust from your sight. You still saw through it and wondered what more there was to his relationship with Radish. Since you met them, they were always at each other\u2019s throats: the Talent Show, the Winter Dance, even during the field trip to the Met where someone burned one and a half garbage cans in the 5th-floor restroom. \n\u201cI told you not to approach me, brother,\u201d Survey spoke barely above a whisper, so only you and Radish could hear. The temperature dropped and Radish\u2019s bright smile dissipated, replaced with a pair of thin lips. \n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t need to happen right now. I\u2019m not talking to you, Survey; you know that,\u201d Radish replied. There was intense tension between the two, and Y/N was like a Stretch Armstrong in the hands of two toddlers high on too much sugar. \n\u201cW- well, uh, Radish, what did you want to say?\u201d your face turned red as a tomato, though you tried to act cool as a cucumber.\nRadish pushed his bright green bowl cut from his eyes. \u201cWould you like to grab a bubble tea and play laser tag with me on Saturday?\u201d He spoke in a sing-song, \u201cI\u2019ll pay for extra toppings!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t even joke about that,\u201d Survey barked. \u201cOf course she has to study over the weekend. There\u2019s no other reason she wouldn\u2019t go to the library with me.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2014\u201d you started, glancing at your wrists.\n\u201cAww, come on!\u201d Radish pulls on your arm. \u201cYou don\u2019t wanna hang with him! I\u2019m so much more fun, Y/N! You won\u2019t regret coming with me.\u201d \n\u201cCome with me, Y/N. I can help you get into a great college.\u201d Survey pushes his glasses up, not looking you in the eyes. \n\u201cI\u2014\u201d you tried to speak again.\n\u201cY/N.\u201d Survey said.\n\u201cY/N!\u201d Radish said.\nThey both spoke at the same time. \u201cWhich one of us are you going with?\u201d\n---------------------------------------------------------\n*A/N: Alright, guys!

    "title": "How to Put On a Nose Strip",
    "authors": ["aramie-ewen"],
    "issue": "november-2021",
    "content": "Nose strips: they're the diversity hire of choice for nose bandages and snoring. They're useful for showing people you're interested in stopping your pesky loud breathing without actually taking action.\n\nAnd yet some people, cough, don't even know how to put on a damn nose strip properly. They'll simply slap a strip on their nose, call it a night, and blissfully go off to keep the innocent members of their household up all night with their snoring.\nI've had enough of it. So, people, here's how you're supposed to put on a goddamn nose strip so you can sleep sweetly and tightly without starting an earthquake so powerful Poseidon would be proud.\n\nTo begin placing your nose strip, first put your first nose strip over your nostrils. The absurd over-nose tape won't completely cover both nostrils, but your breathing should make it wiggle like a flattened worm. The flapping should be so strong the strip will make you wonder if it ever considered a career in dance. The flapping will make you wonder if it ever wanted to fly. The flapping will tickle the bottom of your nose a bit. Of course, the nose strip won\u2019t fly. Nose strips can't fly. Or dance. Or follow their petty, beautiful dreams and aspirations. At this point, you will feel immensely sad about that fact. Get through it, however, and the next steps will go by much more smoothly.\nThe next nose strip will be placed vertically over your mouth, so it looks like you now have two narrow mouths. Don't be startled by this, it's completely normal. You did not grow another mouth; you have simply effectively divided your mouth in two.\nWell, as it turns out, the first nose strip was, in fact, always interested in dancing. Heartwarmed by your sadness over its inability to follow its dreams, your nose nose strip has finally decided to try. Help them. Now, you must lie down so your nose strips may dance across your face. They've been apart for a long time\u2014ever since you took them out of the box.\nBut this frightens you. Maybe nose strips were never made to dance, to leap, to fly over your face. It's terribly beautiful. It's too much. So, you'll give your nose strips a moment and then rip them apart. You'll throw them out, burn them, and run away.\n\nYou will run back, however. You'll run back because you shouldn't have set your garbage can on fire. Next-door neighbor Susan wouldn't like to wake up to a fire\u2014even less than waking up to your incessant snoring.\nStill, take a deep breath. You deserve it-\nAt this point, the nose strips will fly inside your nose. They will turn into mush, thinly coating the inner walls of your nose. That mush will form a small army of people within you. Marching, marching deep inside, they will find the recorder hidden in your skull emitting snoring noises and lightly tap it with a rubber hammer. That won\u2019t do anything, though. It\u2019s a rubber hammer, come on.\nWhen they\u2019re done checking the noise box\u2019s reflexes, they'll walk out. The little guys will salute you and you'll feel like you did something. Those nose strips will never dance again, the rubber hammer will not affect your snoring, and Susan's house will still burn down because you didn't stop your garbage fire soon enough\u2014but you know what? Good on you. For a moment, those nose strips lived the dream.",

    "title": "History of the PEZ Dispenser",
    "authors": ["bora-bromberg"],
    "issue": "december-2021",
    "content": "Ah, the PEZ dispenser. The classic toy, the classic candy. A classic combination all true Americans dream of. A candy-dispensing body, iconic character head, and disgusting chawky pellets come together in the greatest invention of all of mankind. One may ask themselves, where and when did this glorious idea come from? Well, I\u2019m here to tell you the facts of this glorious classic\u2019s history, as also stated on trustworthy sources such as [pezspiracy.com](https://theradishbths.com/).\n\nTo begin our story, we find ourselves in 1942 Connecticut, home of Philip E. Zastname, a 23-year-old man about to leave home for the war. Philip's mother hands him a pack of his favorite candy: M&Ms. Little does she know that this will change the history of candy forever.\n\nFast-forward to Germany: young Zastname is stationed in a trench. Still holding on to the M&Ms his mother gave him, Philip realizes that the famous slogan was false; M&Ms do, in fact, melt in your hand! With his reality melting in front of him and a dire need to find a solution, Philip places his candy within the used magazine of an automatic gun, to keep them safe during battle.\n\nUnfortunately, just as Philip got ready to join his fellow soldiers, he shot himself in the foot and bled out.\n\nWhen another soldier came to clean up the mess of Zastname, he came across the magazine that Philip had used, marked with his initials: P.E.Z. (Wow! Bet you didn't see that coming!)\n\nThis soldier, named George Jefferson (not related to any founding fathers of America, to be clear), was inspired by Philip\u2019s candy-filled magazine and took it to his workshop.\n\nBelieve it or not, the iconic PEZ candy itself was actually invented by accident, after George spilled wood dust, chalk, and gunpowder into glue\u2014the same recipe that is still sold and \u201ceaten\u201d today!\n\nAfter several explosive prototypes and remarkably few casualties, Jefferson took his invention to the streets. But the product was not a success at first. Some people found the explosive texture off-putting.\u00a0\n\nThat was when George realized the weakness of the invention was a lack of marketability. So, he gave his product large bobble-like heads to convey the fun and Americanness of the product. And, to honor the inspiration for his product, he named it after that fallen soldier Philip Zastname.\n\nThe first PEZ heads were of American icons, such as Uncle Sam, President Roosevelt, and a dead German soldier.\nWith these funky fresh heads came new flavors for the candy, too: molasses, vegetable, and the fan favorite \u201csour.\u201d\n\nThe new marketing strategy was an immediate success and PEZ quickly became a household name.\n\nBut then tragedy struck. PEZ was taken off the shelves. Due to poor production quality and disregard for basic safety standards, PEZ's bobble head dispensers were extremely dangerous, and had been dispensing pain and misery instead of just candy. Child gangs would fire the candy like bullets and then use the feet of the dispenser to stab their foes whilst admiring the President Roosevelt's friendly face. Truly a tragedy, especially considering that the candy was still explosive.\n\nDue to parent complaints, for a period of time, stores had to replace PEZ with the more safe and popular toy/candy combo for kids of the time: a gun and a pack of cigarettes.\nAnd so PEZ disappeared from the face of humanity for several years. During this time, George Jefferson prematurely passed away, most likely due to gunpowder consumption. \nWithout its creator to support it, PEZ seemed doomed to end.\n\nBut then a Christmas miracle happened. LIFE magazine made a typo in their list of the top gifts of 1955. Instead of the number one spot going to \u201cA Pet\u201d (dogs were very popular that year), someone wrote \u201cA Pez.\u201d LIFE tried to fix this typo, but their typo guy\u2019s attempt to write over the \u201cz\u201d in everyone\u2019s copies of the magazine came too late. The public demanded PEZ, and stores had no choice but to put them back on the shelves.\n\nNow under the new management of Jefferson\u2019s son, George Jefferson Jr, new characters were chosen for the PEZ comeback, including Mickey Mouse, Popeye the Sailor Man, and the returning dead German soldier, now further decomposing.\n\nAnd that, my friends, is the story of how the magazine of a weapon became a candy, a weapon again, and then a popular candy once more.\n\nJoin me next month, where I will tell you how the Junior Mint originated from cyanide capsules.",

These jokes, which play on the concept of fraternizing with the subject's mother, have their origins in a secret society within Brooklyn Tech. Although the joke has spread far and wide, it was developed by the imaginations of a shadowy underground organization, often referred to as the Tech \u201cur mom\u201d collective.\nHowever in a recent shake-up, the leader of the Tech \u201cur mom\u201d collective, who has elected to remain anonymous, announced via Discord ping the establishment of \u201cur uncle.\u201d\n> Good evening `@everyone`, \n>\n> The Tech \u201cur mom\u201d collective is disgusted by the overuse of \u201cur mom.\u201d We created this society with the purpose of creating a safe haven of \u201cur mom.\u201d Instead, our inside joke has spread globally.

    "content": "Say goodbye to broken chairs and rows. With the mezzanine closed, it\u2019s finally getting the serious overhaul it needed. With upgrades galore, we are exuberant to see Brooklyn Tech listening to our complaints at long last.\n\nBy far, the most popular request was to remove the stairs. Well, now all the mezzanine\u2019s stairs are being replaced with a slanted autowalk. Take that, Stuyvesant\u2019s escalators.\u00a0\\\nThe biggest problem was that often the beloved mezzanine often ran out of space; it\u2019s just so popular. To help accommodate for this massive demand, the library and cafeteria have arranged crossovers with the mezzanine! Readers, tutors and homework-doers alike will now receive a free live audience with every free period.\n\nNow, I sure bet you\u2019ve been tired of wanting to go to the auditorium but being assigned to a different area. I know I have been. Well, we will be getting a little square of the mezz designated for those assigned to a different area. It\u2019s like segregation but good.\nThe chairs of the mezz will also be upgraded. With this fresh update, chairs are now being arranged in columns rather than rows. The chairs themselves will also now all be made of biodegradable plastic, and there are no longer cushions or \u201csentimental plaques.\u201d\n\nAnd, just for fun: random chairs have been equipped haphazardly with cupholders and/or unfoldable tables. What a fun surprise finding those will be!\n\nWe all know that the balconies are a bit restrictive, so out with the old and in with the new! Instead of balconies, we have spikes made with real oxidized iron! It\u2019s so rusty! Please be sure to keep your tetanus shots up to date if you\u2019re planning on visiting the mezz^2\u2019s balconies, though.\nThis just in: a slightly out-of-tune pipe organ is also being installed on the third floor!

We asked several witnesses for statements about the incident, in an attempt to piece together what occurred.\nA \u201cMrs. J\u201d stated, \u201cApparently, a Discord server code was given out to everyone who doesn\u2019t own a roller backpack. This was organized weeks in advance. Now, if they put this much effort into their school work-\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did you do nothing but stand by your room and watch the backpacks burn? And, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but on the cameras, you seem to be smiling.\u201d She declined to comment any more.\n\nWe managed to catch up with Brandon, who is now living out his three-day suspension in the pizzeria a few blocks down.\n\u201cDo you think extreme violence is necessary for this sort of change to occur?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cNah,\u201d he said through a mouthful of pizza. \u201cJust wanted to throw something out of a window.\u201d\n\n\u201cInteresting. And, is it true that you see roller backpack carriers as, \u2018subhuman \\[REDACTED]s\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cHuh. That\u2019s a toughie. It\u2019s more that I see moms who let their children walk outside with those death traps as subhuman \\[REDACTED]. Their children are weak. So, consider this liberation, Arthur!\u2019\u2019 He exclaimed as he thrust his metal backpack sword into the air.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s told you to get rid of that sword?\u201d\n\u201cSurprisingly, nope. It\u2019s getting kinda greasy.\u201d\n\u201cWait- is that a gym shirt you\u2019re cleaning it with?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not mine. I was planning on selling it back to the kid that threw it at me later. Gotta make money somehow, now that I\u2019m on my own.\u201d\n\u201cDid your parents kick you out?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but they stopped giving me pizza money. Something about \u2018not learning the lesson that violence should never result in free pizza.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cMoving on from pizza, would you consider the suspension worth it?\u201d\n\u201cLet me be a martyr for my comrades in arms. People years from now will look back at this moment, look around the hallways, look down at their ankles, and thank me for doing my part.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight. That was an insightful interview. Thank you for your service.\u201d\nHe threw us a soldier's salute on the way out.\n\nIn an effort to give a voice to both sides, we also decided to speak with Arthur, a victim of yesterday\u2019s incident. He seemed relatively unscathed, except for a scratch on his cheek. We were assured that the scratch was a cut his cat had given him or \u201cotherwise I\u2019d be pressing charges.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo how are you recov-\u201d\n\u201cSome dude spit on me. Full-on spit. I\u2019m a human, not a goddamn centipede.\u201d\n\u201cThat must\u2019ve been awf-\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll own his a\\*\\* one day. I\u2019ll make him pay me back. I\u2019ll make him carry a roller backpack to work. One with purple sparkles and a pony on the cover.\u201d His eyes closed in bliss at the horrible thought.\n\nI cleared my throat and his eyes flew open.\n\n\u201cListen. I believe in one thing only: the power of human will. We roller backpack carriers will get our revenge. It may take a year. It may take twenty. We can wait.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, was that first part a Stalin quote?\u201d\n\u201cWas it?\u201d\nIt was.",

    "content": "In March, we saw the \u201cCheese Challenge\u201d become popular on social media, in which people filmed themselves throwing slices of cheese on their pets and uploading the videos to Twitter and Instagram.\u00a0 Now, a new trend is sweeping the Internet: the Brick Challenge! \nThe Brick Challenge is what you would expect it to be: people posting videos of themselves throwing bricks at their pets, instead of cheese.\u00a0 This challenge has had a variety of responses.\u00a0 One Twitter user wrote: \u201cAfter I threw a brick at my dog, he just stood there motionless, it was so hilarious! It was just like the Cheese Challenge, but there was blood everywhere! I\u2019m totally going to try the challenge again, but I need to get a new dog first.\u201d\n\nSome people have been concerned about the possible dangers of throwing bricks at animals.\u00a0 One animal researcher spoke about how unknown the dangers are, and what could happen if people started throwing more dangerous objects at their pets.\u00a0 \u201cYou know, there\u2019s just not enough research about what happens to a pet\u2019s body when you throw a brick at it.\u00a0 There could be a million dangers of this challenge that we don\u2019t know about yet, and the big brick companies are going to try and hide them from us. And I mean, it\u2019s a slippery slope.\u00a0 First it\u2019s cheese, then it\u2019s bricks, then it\u2019s Boar Vessel, 600-500 BC, Etruscan, ceramic.\u201d \nAnimal rights organization PETA also put out a statement about the challenge. \u201cThrowing bricks at your pets is wrong, and it\u2019s animal abuse.\u00a0 How about you try something more harmless, like throwing bricks at your children?\u201d PETA also posted an \u201cexample\u201d video to their Twitter account of the challenge being performed on a child.\u00a0Along with the video was the caption, \u201cNo animals were harmed in the creation of this video.\u201d\nDespite the warnings, a number of celebrities have tried attempting the Brick Challenge, including Michael Vick, as well as Lonathyn Jastname, before his tragic death.\u00a0 Jack Black also claimed to have tried the challenge out on his pet bird, but this was later disproven due to the fact that birds aren\u2019t real.",

    "content": "<!--StartFragment-->\nEverybody wants something to do over the break, but traditional vacations can be so expensive. A week-long trip to Disney World alone can leave you in debt. That\u2019s why the best way to vacation is a trip that leaves you with more money than you started with. One word, three syllables: piracy.\n\nPiracy is the ideal vacation. Travel the beautiful blue seas and indulge in an abundance of gold and jewelry. While it may be illegal in almost all European, Asian, and African countries, the United States never actually wrote it into the law that piracy is illegal. This means that in any US-owned water, you can still pillage and murder for all the riches you could dream of. The US government CANNOT convict you for piracy!\nAn added benefit of piracy is not having to shower for the whole summer. No one will be able to notice your body odor over the scent of your rotting fingernails from the inevitable scurvy. Additionally, SUNY schools actually accept piracy as summer internship credits, so you can impress them with 2 months worth of hard work while having fun the whole time!\nNow you may be thinking that this sounds like an ad, but let me tell you that you\u2019re wrong. The Pirate Foundation of America does not exist, which is why this article is definitively not a paid ad, just a genuine recommendation for your wellbeing.\nSo instead of blowing all your money on a trip to the beach, consider becoming a pirate this summer!\n<!--EndFragment-->",

    "title": "The Hidden Meaning Behind Pitbull Lyrics",
    "authors": ["maxime-ennis"],
    "issue": "april-2021",
    "content": "Armando Christian P\u00e9rez, Mr. Worldwide, Lil\u2019 Chico, Mr. 305, Dale\u2014whatever you\u2019d like to call him, he is undoubtedly the world\u2019s best rapper/singer/songwriter/brand-ambassador/philanthropist/businessman/actor and most profound lyricist known to man.\n\nWith lyrics such as \u201cNow, no pu-pu-pu-pu-pump it up\" and \"back it up like a Tonka truck / Dale,\u201d you have only scraped the surface of how deep Pitbull\u2019s lyrics get. Today I will get into some Mr. Worldwide lyrics with a more significant meaning than you might think.\nFirst, from his infamous song \u201cHotel Room Service\u201d Armando Christian P\u00e9rez wrote this gem of a lyric: \u201cNow gimme that sweet, that nasty, that Gucci stuff.\u201d\nNow, on the surface, this might just seem like gibberish to you. But it\u2019s more than that. Lil\u2019 Chico is probably over here taking a stand against high fashion brands like Gucci and Chanel.\n\nIn this lyric, he compares Gucci to something both sweet and nasty\u2014just like the high fashion industry. Brands like Gucci sell normal-looking clothing items for incredibly high prices. Pitbull, being the social warrior he is, has evidently realized that\u2019s unfair.\n\nNext up: a lyric from the popular song \u201cGive Me Everything\u201d by Pitbull ft. Neyo. At the beginning of this song he says:\n> Me not working hard?\n>\n> Yeah, right, picture that with a Kodak\n>\n> Or better yet, go to Times Square\n>\n> Take a picture of me with a Kodak\nTo someone who doesn\u2019t look past the surface level, this seems like gibberish. A Kodak? Why is Mr. 305 talking about an outdated camera? Well, you see, the answer is simpler than you might think. It must be, right? Well, if you read all the lyrics, you will find that Pitbull wants the person he is seducing to live in the moment. They might not get tomorrow, so they should do it tonight.\n\nThe Kodak camera symbolizes that their moments need to be remembered with pictures taken from a camera\u2014and not just any camera\u2014a Kodak camera. Pitbull was also secretly sponsored by Kodak at this time.\n\nLastly, from the song \u201cSexy Beaches\u201d ft. Chloe Angelides, we have the most intellectual lyrics on this list. Mr. Worldwide tells the world:\n> I don't bring sand to the beach\n>\n> Bring the beach to the sand\nAt first glance, this seems like utter garbage. Who in their right mind would release this without realizing it sounds stupid? No one brings sand to the beach. That's not a normal thing for people to do.\n\nThis song came out in 2014. It\u2019s been 7 years and no one has acknowledged this line. Well, that\u2019s probably because there is more to this phrase than what meets the eye. This lyric says that, without Pitbull, the beach is just an abandoned desert with polluted plastic, damp sand, and dead fish. But, once Mr. Worldwide is in that desert, it becomes a lively, fun beach filled with people and lots of sand. This is Pitbull\u2019s way of saying that it\u2019s not the world that makes itself bright and happy. People make it better; they bring the sand.\nThis is also a theme in the movie Coraline. Therefore, Pitbull has seen Coraline.\n\nI hope that this helped show you how profound Pitbull\u2019s lyrics are.\u00a0 Each song has such a deeper meaning than it first seems, right? I didn\u2019t waste 4 hours analyzing total garbage, right? You see the meanings, right? These lyrics have some meaning, don\u2019t they? Right? I\u2019m not insane, right?\n\nAnyway, remember that \u201cYou're the biddy-bing-bing-bang-bang, that thang.\u201d And as Pitbull, Armando Christian P\u00e9rez, Mr. Worldwide, Lil\u2019 Chico, Mr. 305 says: Dale!",
