# We are The Radish

We are Brooklyn Technical High School's first, worst, and only satirical newspaper. No clue when we started. Your guess is as good as ours. Still, we've ended up here, so stay awhile :)

# Feed us

Every month we throw articles into the world like a mama bird trying to kill her children. This makes the big radish in the sky very happy. It eats them. Please give us articles to throw. We are begging.
If you're as hungry as the sky radish, there are also plans for a huge wheel of cheese to feed writers. Write an article, get a nibble, that's our motto.

# Contribution requirements

We like nonsense communicated well. If you want to improve your writing, I (Aramie Ewen) like [this article](https://alistapart.com/article/so-you-want-to-write-an-article/). It's aimed at web developers, but the writing-focused tips are great advice in general.

However, for us, just keep in mind the following:

### Required:
- Article is 0.5 page to 2 pages, flexible if the article is good
- You're a BTHS student, flexible if the article is good
- You're willing to work with an editor, **even if** the article is good



### Consider before submitting:
- Do you get to the point?
- Is the article's premise funny on its own and an original take on the concept?
- Did you have fun writing the article?
