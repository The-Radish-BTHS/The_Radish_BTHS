# We are The Radish

We are Brooklyn Technical High School's first, worst, and only satirical newspaper. We probably started around the 1980sâ€”definitely before The Onion, our fierce rival. 

Interested in joining us? Now that school is is session, we are finally meeting in-person! Find us **Wednesdays in room 2N3** after 10th period. Also join our email list for updates.

# Feed us

Every month we throw articles into the world like a mama bird trying to kill her children. This makes the big radish in the sky very happy. It eats them. Please give us articles to throw. We are begging.


If you're as hungry as the sky radish, there are also plans for a huge wheel of cheese to feed writers. Write an article, get a nibble, that's our motto.

# Feed usâ€”without writing

Wanna help us throw the articles? We have teams for preparing them. 

**Team applications have closed for this semester**, but keep an eye outâ€”we may reopen applications for next semester if we see high enough interest ðŸ‘€

### Graphics Team

* Design covers, issue templates, article graphics, and the occasional propaganda

### Editing Team

* Reviews content for grammar, radish-logical content flow, and general hilarity 
* Makes an attempt to force the reader to have a good time

# Contribution requirements

We like nonsense communicated well. If you want to improve your writing, I (Aramie Ewen) like [this article](https://alistapart.com/article/so-you-want-to-write-an-article/). It's aimed at web developers, but the writing-focused tips are great advice in general.

However, for us, just keep in mind the following:

### Required:

* Article is 0.5 page to 2 pages, flexible if the article is good
* You're a BTHS student, flexible if the article is good
* You're willing to work with an editor, **even if** the article is good

### Consider before submitting:

* Do you get to the point?
* Is the article's premise funny on its own and an original take on the concept?
* Did you have fun writing the article?
