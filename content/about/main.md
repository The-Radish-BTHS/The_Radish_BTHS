# We are The Radish

We are Brooklyn Technical High School's first, worst, and only satirical newspaper. No clue when we started. Your guess is as good as ours. But we've ended up here, so stay awhile :)

# Feed us

Every month we throw articles into the world like a mama bird trying to kill her children. This makes the big radish in the sky very happy. It eats them. Please give us articles to throw. We are begging.
If you're as hungry as the sky radish, there are also plans for a huge wheel of cheese to feed writers. Write an article, get a nibble, that's our motto.
