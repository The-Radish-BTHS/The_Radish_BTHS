Yeah, that’s right. I’ve been vaccinated. I hate to admit it, but ever since I was a baby, I’ve always had my shots up to date. I get the yearly flu shots. And with the new booster shots out, I got those, too. I’ve always been a bit of a fan of these vaccines. But that kind of thing is a hobby one keeps to themselves, you know? 

And sure, I am a big vax fan. I know about all of the vaccines. The popular ones and the unreleased ones. (There’s a fourth booster on its way.) I’m not one of those people who makes vaccination their whole personality. In public, I’m just like everyone else. You wouldn’t even know I was vaccinated. But now, in our society, we’ve got a bunch of gatekeepers. People who want you to prove that you’re a “real vaxxer.” It’s ridiculous how all of a sudden you’re “not fully vaccinated” compared to someone who gets three vaccines. Not everyone can collect every booster like the people who can focus their attention on just vaccines. We’re all doing our best.

So anyway, I’m out with my friends when all of a sudden they ask me for proof of vaccination for indoor seating. I don’t really know what to do. I kinda just tell the group to go on without me. Then I realize that maybe I can sneak through, so I tell them I’ll be just a moment. I walk in where I think there’s nobody, but they’re so insistent on the vaccination I end up not going through with the plan. 

Overall, this proof of vaccination thing is ruining my life. People are so obsessed with protecting their vaccinated safe spaces that they ruin the experience for everyone. Their attitude gives us normal people a bad rap. I completely understand where the anti-vaxxers are coming from, and on behalf of the vaccinated, I apologize. The division and hostility of this fandom has gone too far. With all of this in mind, I hope you’re able to see why I'm ashamed to carry my card.
