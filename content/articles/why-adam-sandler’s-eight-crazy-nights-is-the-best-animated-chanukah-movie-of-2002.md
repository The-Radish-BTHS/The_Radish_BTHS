Eight Crazy Nights is a heartwarming and comedic musical-movie about a delinquent named Davy Stone (Adam Sandler) who gets taken in by the sweet, old Whitey Duvall (Adam Sandler) and his sister Eleanor (Adam Sandler).

It is this author’s opinion that Eight Crazy Nights is the absolute best animated Chanukah movie of 2002.

First of all, the music in the story is actually very catchy and moving. One of the best songs, Technical Foul, is performed by the charismatic trio of Adam Sandler, Adam Sandler, and Adam Sandler. Many of the musical numbers are catchy and have very intellectual lyrics such as

> If I don't spray Lysol after moving a bowel
>
> That's a technical foul.

Have you always wanted to see the Foot Locker logo singing or several deer with human excrement in their teeth? Look no further than this classic Chanukah movie, which features all that and more. Be ready to have your heart ripped apart during the most heartbreaking scenes in cinematic history, but not before you get to witness children laugh so hard they release mucus all over a clothed table.

Losing $10.5 million at the box office and receiving a 12% on Rotten Tomatoes, this film truly asks the question, “was it bad or do people just not care about non-Christmas holiday movies?”

Eight Crazy Nights is truly the Chanukah movie to watch if you’re already tired of the two others in existence.

The final reason why Eight Crazy Nights is the best animated Chanukah movie of 2002 is that it’s the only animated Chanukah movie of 2002. Thank you.
