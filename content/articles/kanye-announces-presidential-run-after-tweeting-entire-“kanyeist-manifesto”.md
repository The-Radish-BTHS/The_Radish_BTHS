A shocking new latecomer to the 2020 election, Kanye West, (a new rapper in the indie hip hop scene) makes an announcement about his run for POTUS. Detailed through tweeting (deemed 2018’s political platform of the year), Kanye has laid out his plan in a long and thorough manifesto—The Kanyeist Manifesto. The name and contents would imply that this is merely a “Kanye-ized” version of the Communist Manifesto. Kanye denied these claims and further claims that the idea was all his, stating: “a special shout out to my boy Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels but credit goes to me, let’s not kid ourselves.”

In earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of music into various orders, a manifold gradation of musical skill. In America we have rap, rock, classical, and country. In Korea we have K-pop and everything else; in almost all of these musical genres, again, subordinate gradations.

The modern pop music that has sprouted from the ruins of rock has not done away with bad rap. It has but established new bad rap, new conditions of bad rappers, new forms of struggle in place of old ones.

Our epoch, the epoch of the pop music, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified bad music. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other - pop and rap.

From the rock of the 1970s sprang the-
