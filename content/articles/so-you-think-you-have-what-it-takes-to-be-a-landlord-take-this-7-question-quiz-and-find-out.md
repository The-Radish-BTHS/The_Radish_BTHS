Are you an aspiring British person from the 1830s?  Do you love taking land and being a complete plague on society? Do you want to make people pay 1000s of dollars for walls thinner than Papa John’s pizza? You could be a great landlord!

What kinds of landlords are there? Well, there are the ones who fix everything (including their marriage) with wd-40 and duct tape. The ones who are incapable of not only making it up the stairs to your bathroom but also can’t count high enough to find your apartment. And there are the ones who are nice enough to make you buy the sealant to fix the walls that they broke “fixing” your sink.

Unfortunately, as a landlord, you’ll come in contact with lots of people, many with lots of opinions of how much sealant it takes to fill the hole their (idiot) child made or on how YOU should fix the gas to the stove that THEIR (still idiot) child drowned in water. Then after fixing this problem (possibly through illegal methods we don’t judge), you get to decide how to enact your revenge through the power of the pocketbook. Choosing (1) how much you want to increase the mean price of NYC rent even higher than it already is and (2) how many times a year you want to find a new group of tenants to torture help.

Do you wanna know what kind of landlord you’ll be? Then take this quiz to find out! (and give us ad revenue so we can continue to appease our landlords, some get so angry when you say you’re keeping radishes for some reason.)

Less than 33: Why did you do this quiz in the first place? Go grab a working belt and be an accountant or something.
