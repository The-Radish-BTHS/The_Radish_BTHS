Before I start this article, can I just say how much I am in love with the 1997 Windows XP computer I found on the street this February? It runs Internet Explorer, my new favorite web browser. Since I found it, I haven’t used any other computer or browser to get the latest news and information. So far, everything seems to be accurate. With that out of the way, let's renegade like that Charli D'amelio girl into the rest of this article. 


As of last Friday, March 13th, new COVID-19 rules have closed schools to protect the safety of students and staff. 


If you didn’t already know, COVID-19 is a new virus. Discovered two months ago, in January, it has the same symptoms as the flu, but not quite. Still, it doesn’t look like this virus is going to be a big deal; schools will be open by the end of April!
To get some first-hand insight on what’s going on for students with closed schools, I went outside for the first time in a month. I interviewed some kid I saw from my window making what I think is called a “Musical.ly.” Internet explorer hasn’t released Musical.ly yet, so I doubt it’s good or popular. 


When asked the question, “How do you feel about schools closing due to the new coronavirus?” Steve Dubnut, an 8th grader, answered with, “I mean, it’s happened once already, so I guess it’s not so bad. Wait what do you mean ‘new’ coronavirus? It’s been around for over a year. Also, I’m not in 8th grade. I’m in high school. Anyway, can you please go away? I just posted a Tik Tok.”


I don’t really know what he meant when he said that the virus had “been around for over a year.” Internet Explorer hasn’t told me anything about this virus being a year old, and I trust my beautiful new computer more than “Steve Dubnut,” if that’s really their name. Also, schools have never been closed before, so I think that this kid is a little out of it if you know what I’m saying.


Anyway, stay safe everyone! This is a dangerous virus, but I know we can get through it! Just wait for April, it will all be over by then! Remember to wash your hands and wear a mask. 


Finally, I’d like to take one last moment to thank my new Windows XP computer. I wouldn’t have been able to write this article, let alone learn all about the new trends going on such as “Vine” and the “mannequin challenge,” without it. I would be clueless without it.
