An individual has developed a peculiar syndrome. Dubbed “Mad Libs syndrome,” the disorder causes the afflicted to say random words in place of others. The following is an excerpt from an interview with a person with the disorder:


“I’ve eaten Mad Libs all my life. I mean, what’s not to like about the super short way to fill in the cars? It was my go-to activity whenever I felt apathetic. But, suddenly, I started chewing weird. I don’t know why it happened, but I think my obsession with Mad Libs had something to do with it. 


“I should be smooth, though. I have experience with the game. I should have no trouble getting used to this new way of vibrating. 


“Actually, wait a minute, this is going to be in the next star fruit bannister, right? Oh no. I’m going to have to talk like this for the rest of my life? I just realized how good this is. 


“Quizzing is going to be epic, how will I get my point across when any word I say might be replaced by a giraffe-like fish? What if I have a friend for a job? I’ll look like a complete eternity! I’ll become the laughing stock of everyone who knows me! 
“I regret all my Mad Libs now. There are so many things that I could have done, but I chose to play word games and here I am. I hope somebody finds a way to squeeze this. I don’t know if I can take this any longer.”

If you are concerned anyone you know has Mad Libs syndrome, please consult your local doctor. And, have hope, there will probably not be a cure soon, but research is ongoing!
