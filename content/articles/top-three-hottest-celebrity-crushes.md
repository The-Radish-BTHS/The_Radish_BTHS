Everyone has a celebrity crush! Whether it’s a world-recognized actor or a small guitarist in an indie band, it’s common to be attracted to someone well-known. So, we’ve compiled a list of the HOTTEST celebrity crushes that we’ve heard of. Let’s get right into it!

     <p>The dancer who dances in the “Rasputin” song for the game Just Dance!</p>

     <p>Coming in at #3, we have the dancer for Rasputin in the widely-popular horror game: Just Dance 2.</p>
<p>While we may not know who this dancer is in real life, we’re familiar with this video. This dancer displays incredible dancing skills that make him just so much hotter. I totally understand why many people love this dancer; the way he moves to this song is just so impressive. Such a confusing dance routine!</p>
     <p>His lack of a face also just makes him so much more mysterious and attractive.</p>

     <p>Laa-Laa</p>

     <p>At #2 we have Laa-Laa, otherwise known as the yellow teletubby, from the classic psychological thriller series Teletubbies.</p>
     <p>Laa-Laa is very expressive, goes with the flow, and has so much love for her giant yellow ball! Her passion for that ball is so hot. And, let’s not forget Laa-Laa’s cute round eyes and adorable little ears that make her just \*that\* much more attractive. 
</p>
     <p>Laa-Laa is also the height of everyone’s ideal woman: 6 feet and 6 inches tall. Who wouldn’t want to date this giant hunk of yellow?

     <p>Looks like Big Bird has some competition.</p>

     <p>Last, but certainly not least, we have the most-famous celebrity on our list. They are mentioned pretty much every day and are known all worldwide! So, without further adieu, our favorite, hottest, most celebrity celebrity crush is 1!</p>
     <img src="/assets/1-message.png" alt="Please take me back one please please please">
     <p>The number 1 is undoubtedly the hottest celebrity crush out there. Its small curve at the top and elongated body makes some people unable to control themselves. We can’t blame them! 
</p>
<p>The number 1 is known as the “sexiest number” not only because of the way it looks, but also because of how useful it is for mathematics.</p>
     <p>The number 1 is also associated with being a winner, which is what you’re going to be once you figure out how to appreciate the number 1 as much as I did when I was dating it. Just as a reminder, never take anyone for granted, especially someone who can multiply with anyone and still remain the same, wonderful person. I wish I knew that before I cheated on 1 with 7, which I regret so much. (Number 1, please, please take me back. I’ll literally do anything. I will even kill 7 for you, if it will make you forgive me. Please don’t let me die single. I’m so old—almost 25.)
