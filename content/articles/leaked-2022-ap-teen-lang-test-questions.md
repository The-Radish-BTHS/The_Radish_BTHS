After much pushback from the recent AP English exam, the College Board is finally freshening up their questions for AP English with funky fresh texts relevant to your everyday life: you and your classmates‚Äô messages! After signing a quick and easy waiver to personal privacy‚Äìwhich you did when signing up for a college board account, read the fine print dumb-dumbs‚Äìyou can now get a tailor-made AP test for AP Language relevant to your day-to-day life. When will you apply what you‚Äôre learning in school? Right now!¬†

This is the second test to be created for the digital platform (after AP Japanese) so all administration will be done virtually. Tentative dates range throughout ‚Äúcuffing season‚Äù and students around the nation will first open the test during ‚Äúsad boi hours.‚Äù Questions consist of multiple choice and free response questions using text messages from various platforms that you have sent or received within the last 6 months. However, to reduce the chance of academic dishonesty by contacting the original sender of the messages, all text has been slightly altered and names made anonymous. Questions typically ask about the true meaning of a received text, the effect of slang usage, the implications on your relationship with this other person, and the efficiency of a message. You may also receive some messages you have sent to others and be asked to comment on the appropriateness of your overfamiliarity when ‚Äútalking to‚Äù a person you have shared is attractive to you and the stench of your tangible social ineptitude.

Below are some of our favorite questions from our freshest practice tests and questions on AP Classroom. That's right, we're leaking them all over the place! Unfortunately, we couldn‚Äôt escape the Collegeboard lawyers completely, so we're just going to give your the questions just in case. 

Hope you didn‚Äôt delete any messages ‚Äòcause it‚Äôs time to study up!
