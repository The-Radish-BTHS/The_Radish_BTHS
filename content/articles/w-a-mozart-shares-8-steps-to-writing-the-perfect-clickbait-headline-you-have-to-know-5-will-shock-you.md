Everyone wants to get people to read or hear what they have to say, but not everyone has something worth saying. Fortunately, for those of you who aren’t creative, don’t have anything of interest in your life, orare simply a boring human being, there may be a solution: clickbait articles. You don’t need to write anything interesting, and you probably aren’t smart enough to anyway, so put your attention into the headline. But wait- you aren’t creative enough to write a clickbait headline!? What will you do? Well, here are the ten steps to writing the perfect clickbait article that will never fail.

1. Start with a basic topic.

   Your reader won’t know in advance what you’re writing about if you don’t tell them. So start with your basic idea.

   For example: “Clickbait Titles”


<center><code>< Visit Advertiser ></code></center>


2. Suggest an improvement that your article offers.

   Your reader probably thinks they know everything about the topic. And while they don’t, they know a whole lot more than you, so you’re not there to give them facts. Make them feel completely inadequate and useless without your article, just like you are in reality.

   For example: “Write a Perfect Clickbait Title”


<center><code>< Visit Advertiser ></code></center>


3. Outline a list.

   By making a list, you will encourage your readers to keep reading for longer as they falsely believe they are getting more information. Of course they aren’t, because you aren’t smart enough to know more than your reader, but by outlining that list, you will encourage them to read on as they feel they might miss information if they don’t.

   For example: “Tips for Writing a Perfect Clickbait Title”

4.  Give a number for that list.

   If you don’t give a number, they will give up on your article as they will probably think it just goes on forever. By giving a number, you encourage them to keep reading because they’re “so close…”

   For example: “8 Tips for Writing a Perfect Clickbait Title”

5.  Use words that sound better.

   Words are supposed to sound cool. Make them sound cool.

5.  Name a celebrity who may or may not have shared the elements of your list. Name recognition drives up clicks.

   For example: “W.A. Mozart shares 8 Steps to Writing the Perfect Clickbait Headline”


<center><code>< Visit Advertiser ></code></center>


7.  Claim that a specific point you make is particularly interesting. Of course it isn’t, none of your points are interesting. You’re an uninteresting human being, remember? But by making that claim, people will want to read at least until that point.

   For example: “W.A. Mozart shares 8 Steps to Writing the Perfect Clickbait Headline (#6 Will Shock You!)”


<center><code>< Visit Advertiser ></code></center>


8. Add urgency or necessity. Tell your reader that they MUST read your article- that they simply can’t continue their lives without reading it first.

   For example: “W.A. Mozart shares 8 Steps to Writing the Perfect Clickbait Headline You Have to Know (#5 Will Shock You!)”


<center><code>< Visit Advertiser ></code></center>


And there you have it. These eight steps will consistently create the perfect clickbait title. It may seem a little bit lengthy, but no one will notice, right? Following this formula can never go wrong- it is simply impossible. You’ll get all the clicks you need before you know it. Good luck!
