The due date for the AP Computer Science Principles create task was at the beginning of this month and boy did the College Board receive a lot of submissions. Many students submit games, anything from virtual ping pong to quiz shows. But recently news has gotten out that the College Board has been taking these programs and selling them to the popular video game company, Rockstar Games.

Rockstar is known for a multitude of popular PC and console game series, like Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption. The company was created in 1998 and has released many iconic games since then. So one can imagine the surprise and outrage when it was revealed that they’ve been re-selling programs from AP CSP students!

That’s right: Red Dead Redemption II was actually made with Snap! (Above) A screenshot of the programming responsible for Red Dead Redemption II.

The original creator of the game has attempted to sue Rockstar and College Board, but lost to their argument that, “We cited the source in the code.”

What could this mean for the future of gaming? Is this the new child labor? Will GTA 6 be another stolen game? How can I get my work featured by Rockstar Games? Only time will tell.
