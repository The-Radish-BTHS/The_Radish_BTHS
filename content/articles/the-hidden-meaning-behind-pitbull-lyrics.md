Armando Christian Pérez, Mr. Worldwide, Lil’ Chico, Mr. 305, Dale- whatever name you’d like to call him, he is undoubtedly the world’s best rapper/singer/songwriter/brand-ambassador/philanthropist/businessman/actor and most profound lyricist known to man. 

With lyrics such as “Now, no pu-pu-pu-pu-pump it up /

And back it up like a Tonka truck / Dale,” you have only scraped the surface of how deep Pitbull’s lyrics get. Today I will get into some Mr. Worldwide lyrics with a more significant meaning than you might think.

First, from his infamous song “Hotel Room Service” Armando Christian Pérez wrote this gem of a lyric: “Now gimme that sweet, that nasty, that Gucci stuff.”

Now, on the surface, this might just seem like gibberish to you. But it’s more than that. Lil’ Chico is probably over here taking a stand against high fashion brands like Gucci and Chanel. 

In this lyric, he compares Gucci to something both sweet and nasty—just like the high fashion industry. Brands like Gucci sell normal-looking clothing items for incredibly high prices. Pitbull, being the social warrior he is, has evidently realized that’s unfair. 

Next up: a lyric from the popular song “Give Me Everything” by Pitbull ft. Neyo. At the beginning of this song he says:

“Me not working hard?

Yeah, right, picture that with a Kodak

Or better yet, go to Times Square

Take a picture of me with a Kodak”

To someone who doesn’t look past the surface level, this seems like gibberish. A Kodak? Why is Mr. 305 talking about an outdated camera? Well, you see, the answer is simpler than you might think. It must be, right? Well, if you read all the lyrics, you will find that Pitbull wants the person he is seducing to live in the moment. They might not get tomorrow, so they should do it tonight. 

The Kodak camera symbolizes that their moments need to be remembered with pictures taken from a camera—and not just any camera—a Kodak camera. Pitbull was also secretly sponsored by Kodak at this time. 

Lastly, from the song “Sexy Beaches” ft. Chloe Angelides, we have the most intellectual lyrics on this list. Mr. Worldwide tells the world:

“I don't bring sand to the beach

Bring the beach to the sand”

At first glance, this seems like utter garbage. Who in their right mind would release this without realizing it sounds stupid? No one brings sand to the beach. That's not a normal thing for people to do. 

This song came out in 2014. It’s been 7 years and no one has acknowledged this line. Well, that’s probably because there is more to this phrase than what meets the eye. This lyric says that, without Pitbull, the beach is just an abandoned desert with polluted plastic, damp sand, and dead fish. But, once Mr. Worldwide is in that desert, it becomes a lively, fun beach filled with people and lots of sand. This is Pitbull’s way of saying that it’s not the world that makes itself bright and happy. People make it better; they bring the sand.

This is also a theme in the movie Coraline. Therefore, Pitbull has seen Coraline. 

I hope that this helped show you how profound Pitbull’s lyrics are.  Each song has such a deeper meaning than it first seems, right? I didn’t waste 4 hours analyzing total garbage, right? You see the meanings, right? These lyrics have some meaning, don’t they? Right? I’m not insane, right? 

Anyway, remember that “You're the biddy-bing-bing-bang-bang, that thang.” And as Pitbull, Armando Christian Pérez, Mr. Worldwide, Lil’ Chico, Mr. 305 says: Dale!
