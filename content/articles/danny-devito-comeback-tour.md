Due to the pandemic, there hasn’t been much news from the entertainment industry besides the odd Pixar movie or Netflix special. That is about to change. The living spirit of the internet, red M&M Danny Devito, was recently featured in a slew of new content. 

Many think Danny Devito is older than the universe itself, but he still got his start in Hollywood just like anyone else. Mike Wazowski in Monsters Inc. was his breakout role. Since then, he has also been the voice actor for Darth Vader and was in Star Wars: A New Hope. However, he was later replaced due to behind-the-scenes drama with R2D2. 

Graciously, he is not bound by the laws of our mortal realm. So, he has been able to land a wide variety of roles. He will be playing Barry B. Benson in the live-action remake of The Bee Movie and Oscar the Grouch in the Broadway Sesame street spin-off titled, The Trash Man. When asked to comment on these upcoming performances, Mr. Devito said, “Elmo better watch his back.” The Trash Man a surprising, but not entirely unexpected, return to the world of children’s entertainment for Mr. Devito. In 2006, he dropkicked Barney the Dinosaur, saying, “He doesn’t love you, and after this, he definitely won’t love me anymore. You’ll see.” 

Outside of Hollywood, Danny Devito has also found success. Recently, he broke into the music industry. After sneaking backstage, he opened for BTS in a concert back in April 2019. Since then, he has released a steady stream of music. He put out an R&B song with John Legend last June, but with M’s instead of the “R” and “B” to “fit his roll” better. Mr. Devito was also rumored to be the one singing the national anthem at the inauguration of Joe Biden, however, he was passed over for Lady Gaga, which many considered a mistake. 

At least Danny Devito is finally making his long-awaited comeback. All we can do is watch in horror and disbelief as he claws his way out of the dumpster fire that Hollywood has become, until, like the glorious phoenix he is, he rises from the ashes as a glorious Oscar the Grouch. When will he die? When he gets bored. But for now, he’s owning the world of entertainment.
