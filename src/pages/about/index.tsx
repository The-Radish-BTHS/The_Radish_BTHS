        We are Brooklyn Technical High School&apos;s first, worst, and only

        before The Onion, our fierce rival. <br />

        Interested in joining us? Once school is in session we will be meeting

        Every month we throw articles into the world like a mama bird trying to
        kill her children. This makes the big radish in the sky very happy. It
        eats them. Please give us articles to throw. We are begging. <br />
        <br />
        If you&apos;re as hungry as the sky radish, there are also plans for a
        huge wheel of cheese to feed writers. Write an article, get a nibble,
        that&apos;s our motto.

      <Heading fontSize="1.5rem">Graphics Team</Heading>
      <Text mb="1.25rem">
        The graphics team is the artists. The storytellers. The people who spent
        too much time in the arts and crafts sections of anywhere they went.
        They are in charge of designing the covers, page layouts, and article
        graphics of each issue. Someone needs a minion riding a llama through
        ancient Greece. They&apos;ll be there. Your article doesnt make sense
        without a picture of a sentient mushroom eating the Joker? No problem.
        The graphics team is in charge of making each issue pop off the page
        (and making propoganda). Sound interesting? Of course it does. See you
        there.

      <Heading fontSize="1.5rem">Editing Team </Heading>
      <Text>
        The editing team edits. They take your random piles of b*llshit and turn
        them into prettier piles of b*llshit, while still letting your
        unmistakable stench through. The editing staff knows grammar, how
        english works, and of course makes them jokes good. They&apos;re the
        people that force the reader to have a good time and they always most of
        the time succeed. Did your fifth grade english teacher always tell you
        that you were their favorite? Then this is the team for you.
