We are Brooklyn Technical High School's first, worst, and only satirical newspaper (website).

Feel free to submit a pull request and add on!

## Our wishlist:
- [ ] Better resizing for our 404 page (mobile viewing is kind of broken)
- [ ] More newspaper-y layout on the [home page](https://theradishbths.com)
  - Still with the most recent issue though
- [ ] More descriptive banner images (don't need to pull, just email us)

## Running The Site Locally
1. Install all dependencies using npm && start using `npm start`
2. To run the local admin page, run `npx netlify-cms-proxy-server`
      - You might need to set up your own Netlify Identity system if you aren't working with [@AwareErmine](https://github.com/AwareErmine)
