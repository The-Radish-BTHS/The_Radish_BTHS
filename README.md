# The Radish... 2.0!!

The Radish site is new and improved!

The Radish BTHS is Brooklyn Tech's first, worst, and only monthly satirical newspaper. Every week, The Radish delivers a fresh batch of articles to the hungry mouths of Brooklyn Technical High School students everywhere.

## Code
The Radish site was made by the Radish Website Development Team (Rad WebDev Team because we're rad). The site uses Next.js with Typescript and uses Vercel and Railway for hosting. Chakra UI is used for styling and Google Cloud Storage for image storage.

## Contribution
If you are a Brooklyn Tech student and you want to help out, join the Radish and become a part of an awesome community of funny people!
